","Driving with an unsecured pet isn’t an offence, but driving carelessly is31st Jan 2020ClaimIt’s against the law to travel with an unrestrained pet in your car.ConclusionIt’s not against the law to drive with your pet unsecured, but if the animal distracts you or you have an accident then this could be an offence.A post that’s been shared on Facebook almost 60,000 times claims it’s now against the law to travel with an unrestrained pet in your car. It gives some examples of how to keep your pet restrained, like putting a dog in a harness attached to a seatbelt. Failing to do so, it claims, could mean you’re given a fine of up to £2,500 and penalty points on your licence, and says this may also invalidate insurance claims after accidents.It is not an offence to travel with an unrestrained pet, but it could count against you if you have an accident. It’s also unsafe for you and your pet.Rule 57 of the Highway Code in both Great Britain and Northern Ireland says:“When in a vehicle, make sure that dogs and other animals are suitably restrained so they cannot distract you while you are driving or injure you, or themselves if you stop quickly. A seat belt harness, pet carrier, dog cage or dog guard are ways of restraining animals in cars.”Breaking the Highway Code isn’t on its own an offence, but it can be used in court to show that you’re liable for what happened after an accident if you didn’t follow it.Driving with an unrestrained pet could contribute to something that is an offence, for example “careless and inconsiderate driving”. Police can issue a fixed penalty notice on the spot—which amounts to a fine of £100 and three points on the driver’s licence—in “low harm” cases. The driver has the option of refusing the fine and choosing to go to court instead. In more serious cases police can report the driver to be summonsed to court.The Highway Code says this offence carries the possibility of an unlimited fine, possible disqualification from driving and between three and nine points on your licence.If your case goes to court and you are sentenced then one of the factors that determines the extent of any fine, points and driving ban is how culpable you were in the offence.This article is part of our work factchecking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here. For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as partly false because driving with an unrestrained pet isn’t illegal, but if the animal distracts you or you have an accident it could be an offence.

1,fullfact,"Dettol antiseptic spray says it kills human coronavirus.
","The makers of Dettol did not know about the new Wuhan coronavirus before the rest of us30th Jan 2020ClaimDettol antiseptic spray says it kills human coronavirus.ConclusionThat is correct but that doesn’t mean that Dettol spray can kill the new coronavirus identified in Wuhan. Coronavirus is a category of viruses that includes the common cold, and it is likely this the label is referring to.A photo of the back of a Dettol bottle, which mentions that it kills “human coronavirus”, has been shared on Facebook over a thousand times.The implication seems to be that the new coronavirus observed in Wuhan, China is not new, or was somehow anticipated.The image does seem to be a genuine label on a Dettol spray product. Several Dettol products mention that they are “proven to kill…Human Coronavirus”. However, some comments under the Facebook post note that “Salmonella” is misspelled on the label. We don’t know why that is, although the brand’s Australian website also seems to misspell it.The key point here is that coronavirus is a broad category of viruses which includes a number of different respiratory illnesses. One is the common cold, but the category also includes SARS (the severe acute respiratory syndrome of which there were outbreaks in 2002 and 2004), and the new coronavirus identified in Wuhan.The “human coronavirus” mentioned on the back of the Dettol bottle is almost certainly referring to the common cold.The coronavirus identified in Wuhan is a new virus, which hadn’t been identified in humans before the first cases at the end of 2019.This article is part of our work factchecking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here. For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as true because although the Dettol spray does mention coronavirus, that’s a whole family of respiratory viruses, including the common cold, as well as this new coronavirus virus from Wuhan.

2,fullfact,"Deaths have risen in the UK since 2011.
","UK death rates have stayed the same since 20114th Feb 2020ClaimDeaths have risen in the UK since 2011.ConclusionThis is correct, but after accounting for the changing size and age structure of the UK, rates of death have stayed about the same since 2011. This represents a stalling of death rates following decades of falling death rates.A graph shared on Twitter appears to show that the number of deaths in the UK has risen steeply from 2011 to 2018, after falling for decades.While the numbers are accurate, using raw figures to look at trends over time can be misleading. After accounting for changes in the size and age structure of the UK population, rates of deaths have remained about the same since 2011.This represents a stalling of the trend after a long period of death rates decreasing and is largely due to changes in the number of people dying from heart disease and stroke, as well as spikes in winter deaths.Number of deaths on the rise in the UKThe graph shows a period of decline in the number of deaths in the UK from the 1970s to 2010s. This is followed by an apparently steep increase, from 552,232 deaths in 2011 to 616,014 in 2018.The numbers that are published in this graph are correct. The data originates from official death statistics published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). When writing about deaths in England and Wales, which made up the majority of all UK deaths, the ONS writes that: “2018 saw the highest number of deaths since 1999”.However, there are some problems with the data presented in the graph. Firstly, the vertical axis on the graph may mislead readers. The number starts at 520,000 rather than zero. This can have the effect of exaggerating the presented trend.Secondly, the numbers do not account for the age and size of the population, which means the figures could be misleading.Adjusting for population size and age structureThe population of the UK has been steadily getting older as people live longer and fewer babies are born.An older population means that there are more people living with long-term conditions, which make them susceptible to flu and other winter risks.We’ve produced our own version of the chart from ONS mortality rates, which accounts for these factors. This shows that the rate of death remained at about 1,000 per 100,000 people between 2011 and 2018.Why have death rates not improved in the last decade?Before 2011, rates of death had been steadily declining. The ONS calculates that for each decade between 1910 and 2010, life expectancy at birth increased by nearly three years.Public Health England have looked at the reasons why death rates have flatlined in recent years. Key reasons include the fact that although the number of people dying from heart disease and stroke is still falling, it’s not falling as fast as it once was, and there has also been a spike in winter deaths over the last five years. Other factors include an increase in the number of deaths from chronic lower respiratory disease and, among people age 20-44, accidental poisoning.There has also been an increase in the number of deaths due to dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, although this is largely down to increased diagnosis and recording of these diseases.

3,fullfact,"The government’s own research says that Boris Johnson’s Brexit proposals would lead to a 6.7% drop in GDP.
","This comparison between Brexit’s impact and the financial crisis is flawed18th Oct 2019ClaimThe government’s own research says that Boris Johnson’s Brexit proposals would lead to a 6.7% drop in GDP.ConclusionThe government estimated a free trade agreement Brexit could lead to GDP being 6.7% lower after 15 years than if the UK remained in the EU. That’s not the same as saying this form of Brexit will lead to a drop in GDP compared to now. The government’s own research says that Boris Johnson’s Brexit proposals would lead to a 6.4% drop in real wages. The government estimated a free trade agreement Brexit could lead to real wages being 6.4% lower after 15 years than if the UK remained in the EU. That’s not the same as saying this form of Brexit will lead to a drop in real wages compared to now. Boris Johnson’s Brexit proposals would lead to the kind of hit to the economy experienced in the financial crash. This is an unfair comparison as it equates real drops in GDP and wages during the financial crisis to the loss of potential earnings over longer time periods as a result of Brexit.Claim 1 of 3“The Government's own research says that Boris Johnson's Brexit proposals would lead to a 6.7% drop in GDP and 6.4% drop in real wages - the kind of hit to the economy experienced in the financial crash.” Chuka Umunna, 18 October 2019Mr Umunna was referencing economic analyses published by the government in November 2018, which modelled the economic outcomes under different Brexit scenarios. But he’s wrong to say GDP and real wages would “drop” according to this analysis and his comparison to the financial crash is misleading.The government estimated that a hypothetical free-trade agreement (FTA) with the EU where we maintained tariff-free access but there were still non-tariff costs (such as regulatory barriers) would cost the UK between 4.9% and 6.7% GDP growth after 15 years. GDP (or Gross Domestic Product) is the total value of everything that happens within a country’s economy—the goods and services made and the money earned. It’s the main way economists measure how well the economy is doing.The FTA scenario is the most likely scenario following the deal agreed by Boris Johnson’s government and the EU, though the details of the trade deal would not be agreed for a while yet, so this is all still hypothetical. However, that aside, it’s incorrect to claim the analysis said that the proposals would lead to a 6.7% drop to GDP, as Mr Umunna said. The analysis said that GDP would be up to 6.7% lower after 15 years than it would have been compared to remaining in the EU. The document said “in all scenarios the economy would be expected to grow.”It’s worth mentioning that the 6.7% figure assumed that the net migration from the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) to the UK would fall to zero—in other words the number of EU immigrants coming to the UK would be balanced by the number emigrating abroad. Other estimates of the free-trade model with a more liberal migration policy were estimated to have a lower impact on GDP.  More recently think tank UK in a Changing Europe estimated GDP per person would be between 2.3% and 7% lower under Mr Johnson’s deal than remaining in the EU after 10 years.  The comparison to the financial crisis is unfairMr Umunna claimed that the scale of the impact on GDP would be comparable to the financial crash.This is an unfair comparison. Between the first quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009, GDP fell by 6%. GDP per person fell even more, by 8.5% over that period. But the key thing is that GDP is still expected to grow in real terms under the new withdrawal agreement. It’s unfair to compare the tangible loss in incomes and earnings over a period of 15 months during the financial crisis, with a similarly sized loss of potential earnings over a period of 15 years.  For wages, the comparison is even more problematic. Weekly wages fell, in real terms (adjusting for changes in prices) by 11.2% between the high in February 2008 and the low during March 2014. This covers wages for employees in Great Britain. So not only is the comparison between a real cut to peoples’ wages during the financial crisis and a hypothetical loss of earnings due to Brexit, the level of financial loss is fairly different. The government estimates wages to be 6.4% lower over a fifteen year period. During the financial crisis and its aftermath, wages fell by 11.2% over six years.Putting these figures in contextThe new withdrawal agreement is seen to be a “harder” Brexit than that negotiated under Theresa May. As such, economists estimate the impact on the economy to be greater. UK in a Changing Europe modelled the impact of Theresa May’s deal, Boris Johnson’s deal and a no deal “WTO” Brexit. It estimated that, after ten years, GDP per person would be around £1,500 less under May’s deal, £2,000 less under Johnson’s deal and £2,500 less under no deal, compared to staying within the EU. Its analysis took into account two things: the expected direct impact of Brexit on trade volumes and the cost of doing trade, and the knock-on impact that trade can have on productivity (which accounted for most of the costs).As mentioned before, these estimates don’t necessarily mean that people will be worse off by £2,500 in ten years than they are now. They estimate people will be less well off by that much than if we had remained in the EU.Economic forecasts over such long periods and where the details of what might happen in the future are unknown must be taken with a large pinch of salt.  As UK in a Changing Europe says: “As we have emphasised throughout, these estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, for two reasons.“First, there is inherent uncertainty associated with forecasting the impact of economic policy choices. “Second, there is also political uncertainty as to what those future policy choices will be, both on the part of the UK and the EU. “Nevertheless, it should be clear that under any plausible scenario the costs associated with Brexit’s potential economic effects are much larger than the savings from reduced contributions to the EU budget.”                    By Abbas Panjwani                  Share this:FacebookTwitterWe aim for our fact checks to be as accurate and up-to-date as possible.

4,fullfact,"A three month extension to Brexit will cost £1 billion a month.
","Boris Johnson repeats his false claim that extending Brexit costs £1 billion a month29th Oct 2019ClaimA three month extension to Brexit will cost £1 billion a month.ConclusionNo it won’t. The UK would still pay that amount if it left in October under Boris Johnson’s deal.“They made it inevitable that the people of this country would be retained in the EU against their will for at least another three months, at a cost of another £1 billion a month.” Boris Johnson, 28 October 2019“It is a week since this parliament voted, yet again, to force Brussels to keep this country in the European Union for at least another three months, at a cost of £1 billion a month.”Boris Johnson, 29 October 2019In the House of Commons this week, Boris Johnson has twice repeated his claim that extending the date of Brexit for three months would cost £1 billion a month.This is false, as we have said repeatedly. A three month extension costs the UK the same amount in EU budget payments as leaving under Boris Johnson’s own deal on 31 October would have.Mr Johnson should correct his untrue statements to the House.Why it’s wrongThe claim is based on the amount that the UK pays into the EU budget. Those payments are worth roughly £1 billion a month, although this doesn’t take into account some money that the UK gets back from the EU, as BBC Reality Check has pointed out. But under Boris Johnson’s proposed deal, the UK will pay these budget contributions even after we’ve left the EU, until the end of December 2020. This is part of the financial settlement (better known as the “divorce bill”).This is the same situation as under Theresa May’s deal—Boris Johnson’s government did not renegotiate the financial settlement.That means the budget payments made during a Brexit extension to January 2020 simply have the effect of reducing the total divorce bill upon the UK’s departure. This has already happened before: the divorce bill was estimated at around £39 billion in March 2019, but is now down to around £33 billion as a result of extending the Brexit date by six months.There is a separate decision that the government will need to make before 1 July 2020, about whether the UK wants to extend the transition period that follows Brexit beyond its current end date of December 2020. The dates of this transition period have not changed from Theresa May’s deal to Boris Johnson’s deal.If the government does decide to extend that period, and the EU agrees to the extension, that would mean that the UK would need to pay into the EU budget for a longer period. At this point the UK and EU would have to negotiate what level of budget contribution the UK would make during the extended transition.The Ministerial Code, which governs the behaviour of ministers—and which the Prime Minister himself is in charge of enforcing—says that it is “of paramount importance that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity.” The Prime Minister should uphold these principles and correct his untrue statements in the House of Commons.

5,fullfact,"In January 2020 a new EU law means anyone who has an offshore bank account will have to “come clean so we can see how much they are hiding”.
","Claim Brexit is about concealing offshore accounts is baseless30th Sep 2019ClaimIn January 2020 a new EU law means anyone who has an offshore bank account will have to “come clean so we can see how much they are hiding”.ConclusionIncorrect. There is no such EU law coming into place.“come January 2020 the EU are bringing in a law saying that anyone who has a Off shore account will have to come clean so we can see how much they are hiding and to see if it can be taxed. No longer being able to get away with tax avoidance & evasion is what Brexit is about”Terry Christian, 1 September 2019A widely-shared tweet by the broadcaster Terry Christian claims that the EU is bringing in a law in 2020 which will mean anyone with an offshore account will have to “come clean” and potentially have their income taxed. Avoiding this, he claims, is “what Brexit is about”. The tweet has been shared over 10,000 times, and screenshots of it have also circulated on Facebook.It’s unclear exactly which law Mr Christian is referring to—there are a couple of laws he could mean. However, we can’t find any interpretation of this claim that would make it correct.We’ve found two sets of EU laws (relating to tax avoidance and money laundering) that we think he could be referring to, as at least some parts come into place in January 2020. However, neither of these forces the owners of offshore accounts to “come clean” as the tweet describes.There are some new EU laws on tax avoidanceOne possibility is that he is referring to the EU’s new “anti tax avoidance directive”, the last part of which has to be applied in member states by 1 January 2020 (although it’s unclear if they will still take effect if we leave with no deal at the end of October).However, its purpose is not to reveal money hidden in offshore accounts.The directive has five key legal aspects relating to:limiting interest (capping the amount of tax deductible interest a company can have),the rules around exit taxation (the taxes on companies when they leave a country),the rules around controlled foreign companies (to stop the diverting of profits to low-tax countries),general anti-abuse rules (to counter ‘aggressive tax planning’ that doesn’t necessarily break any specific rules), and;rules on hybrid mismatches (when companies exploit the differences between countries’ tax systems).Broadly, the new directive is intended to prevent corporate tax avoidance practices, and has been planned since 2015. It “aims to address situations where corporate groups take advantage of disparities between national tax systems” to reduce the amount of tax they have to pay.In practice, this aims to tackle large companies shifting profits from the EU country in which they were made to a country with a lower tax rate or “preferential” rules. This could be another EU country, or a non-EU country.So these policies are about tightening up “systemic issues” to do with tax law in EU countries, to make it harder for companies to practice what the EU calls “aggressive tax planning”.Most of these policies are already in placeThree of the five provisions of the new tax avoidance directive are already in place, with EU countries (including the UK) having to adopt them by 31 December 2018.HMRC told us that the new EU rules on interest restriction and the general anti-abuse rule led to no changes in the UK, because the UK’s existing rules already met or exceeded the minimum standards set.There were some minor changes made to controlled foreign companies rules, but none were expected to have any significant impact on individuals or the economy.The two EU provisions not yet in place are on exit tax and hybrid mismatches. The UK must meet the EU’s new standards on these by the start of 2020.HMRC told us the exit tax rules would lead to two “minor” changes.It’s also possible Mr Christian was referring to another EU policy coming into force next January: the fifth anti-money laundering directive. This will require member states to put mechanisms in place to identify ownership information on bank and payment accounts and safe-deposits. The EU told us that this does not cover bank accounts held outside the EU.This article is part of our work factchecking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

","Viral post has flawed understanding of EU debt20th Sep 2019ClaimGreece owes 367 Billion.ConclusionGreece’s national debt is worth €337 billion. Ireland owes 865 Billion. Ireland’s national debt is worth €215 billion Spain owes 1 Trillion. Spain’s national debt is worth €1.2 trillion. Italy owes 1 Trillion. Italy’s national debt is worth €2.4 trillion. If the UK leaves the EU, France and Germany’s economies will collapse. There is no evidence that this would be the case. Greece has said it will collapse when we leave the EU. It has not. Spain wants money from the UK to cover its debts. We’ve seen no evidence it has asked for this, and the amounts Spain receives from the EU budget are a tiny fraction of its debt.Claim 1 of 7“Here’s the reason the EU won’t let us just walk away.“Greece owes 367 Billion“Ireland owes 865 Billion“Spain owes 1 Trillion“Italy owes 1 Trillion“When the UK walks away it will apply pressure to France and Germany’s economies, along with Britain they’ve been propping up the EU, and they will collapse under the pressure if we walk away.Spain has attempted to blackmail Britain with this whole Gibraltar rubbish, wanting money from us to cover their debts, while Greece has stated they will collapse when we walk.It’s not about unity, or how great we are; it’s about money.”Facebook user, 9 July 2019Viral posts on Facebook make claims about how much a number EU countries “owe”. They have been shared over 20,000 times. The numbers given for how much each country owes seem to relate to the size of government debt in those countries—they are a mixture of accurate and inaccurate.The posts also says that if the UK leaves the EU, France and Germany’s economies will collapse “under the pressure”, and that Greece has also warned it will “collapse”. There is no evidence for this.The size of EU countries’ debtsThe post overstates the size of Ireland’s debt, which it claims to be “865 billion”. The latest data from the first three months of 2019 shows Ireland’s gross national debt was €215 billion.The post understates the size of Italy’s debt, which it claims to be “1 trillion”. Italy’s national debt is worth €2.4 trillion.The post was roughly accurate in its reporting of the other two figures—Greece’s debt is worth €337 billion, and Spain’s is worth €1.2 trillion.It’s worth noting that these countries are not alone in having debts—as we’ve written before, not necessarily a bad thing that a government has debt, and almost all countries do. The UK’s national debt is worth €2.1 trillion.It’s also helpful to understand the size of a country’s debt in relation to the overall size of its economy. (A debt of €2 trillion is easier for an economy the size of the UK’s to sustain, than it would be for an economy the size of Luxembourg’s).The UK’s debt is worth around 85% of its total GDP. That level is higher than Ireland’s (66%), but lower than in Spain (99%), Italy (134%) and Greece (182%).The UK is not propping up the EU’s debtThe post claims that when the UK leaves the EU, France and Germany’s economies will collapse “under the pressure”.From the context of the post, this seems to be referring to the fact that with the UK no longer paying into the EU budget, France and Germany will have to shoulder more of the cost. It’s correct that the UK has made one of the largest contributions to the EU budget in recent years, along with Germany, France, and Italy. (The exact ranking order depends on which years you look at and whether you count money going from the EU to private organisations within the UK.)However, the EU is preparing a budget for 2021-2027 that doesn’t include the UK. The EU acknowledges that Brexit will leave a “sizeable gap” in the budget, but says this will be managed through increased contributions and decreased spending in some areas. We’ve seen no indication that France or Germany think they will be unable to manage the new budget payments.The post goes on to say that Spain wants UK money to cover their debts, and that Greece has stated they will collapse when the UK leaves the EU.This latter claim is likely based on press reports from 2018 that claimed Greece had warned that a no deal Brexit would trigger (in the words of the Express) “EU economic meltdown”. This is extremely overstated: it’s actually based on a paper by a researcher at the Greek Ministry of Rural Development & Food that is specifically about what would happen to the EU budget if the UK left in March 2019 (which was the expected leaving date at the time)and refused to pay the “divorce bill”.It says that says one possible approach the EU might take to covering this budget shortfall “could result in increased financial and political instability” in Greece, and it advocates for a different approach. Nowhere does it say that Brexit will cause Greece to collapse.Looking at the bigger picture, Brexit would not suddenly make the debts of other EU countries unsustainable.The EU’s budget is not directly used for managing the debt of member states, and it’s implausible to suggest that any change in the amounts Spain or Greece receive from the EU post-Brexit would be large enough to significantly affect their debt. The sums they currently receive from the EU budget are a fraction of their total national debt.For example, Greece received just under €3.4 billion from the EU budget in 2018 (once you factor in the amount it paid into the budget)—around 1% of the total value of its debt. Spain received just under €2 billion—around 0.2% of the total value of its debt. We don’t know exactly how much these countries will receive from the EU budget after the UK leaves the EU, but the next EU budget will be broadly similar in size to the current one. That means any change to a given country’s income is likely to be relatively small.A no deal Brexit would of course likely have larger economic effects than just the change in EU budget contributions, which could negatively impact the economies of EU countries and the UK.  This article is part of our work factchecking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

UK in a Changing Europe said that GDP per person would grow by 7% less under Boris Johnson’s deal after ten years compared to a scenario where the UK remains in the EU and maintains the status quo. It did not find that GDP would fall by 7% over the ten years.That could well mean that the UK economy still grows over this period, but more slowly than if we remained in the EU. This isn’t the first example of people wrongly assuming that forecasts of Brexit’s negative impact on GDP equate to a fall in GDP compared to where it is now.UK in a Changing Europe wrote: “[We do not] attempt to forecast how much the UK economy will grow over the next ten years.“Rather, we address the narrower question of the change in the UK’s income per capita if the future relationship with the EU were based on Mr Johnson’s proposals.It’s worth noting that UK in a Changing Europe modelled numerous scenarios. A 7% fall in GDP per capita is under a system where the UK has a restrictive migration policy and productivity is affected.The scenario in which GDP is least affected is where there is a liberal migration policy and productivity is not affected. This, UK in a Changing Europe estimates, would reduce GDP by 2.3% over a ten year period compared to remaining in the EU.

","Old claim about Brexit economic boost resurfaces18th Jul 2019ClaimNew analysis shows that the UK will be £135 billion richer with no deal.ConclusionThe analysis in question is two years old, and claims that GDP would grow by £135 billion if the UK unilaterally removed all barriers to international trade after Brexit. The analysis has been criticised by other economists, especially for its argument that the UK would not face new non-tariff barriers to trade with the EU in this scenario.“New Brexit Analysis Humiliates Remainers As UK Will Be £135bn Richer With No Deal”The British Journal, 8 July 2019An article on the website The British Journal, dated 8 July 2019, says “the latest report by the Economists for Free Trade have calculated that the opportunities from the UK going global under a “No Deal” Brexit may give the UK an extra £135 billion per year.”The article has received over 35,000 shares on Facebook (using analysis from Crowdtangle) since its publication earlier this month, but the report in question is not new—it was published two years ago. Many users may have mistaken it for genuinely breaking news though, because The British Journal originally published the article with the BBC’s old breaking news image. It has since changed this to a generic “breaking news” image.That matter aside, a wide range of other economists have criticised Economists for Free Trade’s estimate about the economic gains from a no deal Brexit.Where does £135 billion come from?Two years ago Economists for Free Trade (EFT) claimed that the UK economy would be better off by “as much as £135 billion a year” if the UK left the EU without a deal and unilaterally eliminated all trade barriers, including tariffs on imports.Of the £135 billion, £80 billion was estimated to come from “free trade”, £40 billion from reducing regulation, £4 billion from reducing benefit payments to unskilled EU migrants, and £11 billion from no longer paying into the EU budget.  But a wide range of other economists have criticised the group’s estimates and we’ve looked at a few of their main points below.The benefits of free trade have been heavily questionedMuch of the criticism of EFT’s calculation has focused on the points about “free trade”—where it identifies the bulk of the economic growth to come from. EFT’s argument is essentially that, if the UK left the EU on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms, it could remove all tariffs and non-tariff barriers on imports from anywhere in the world, which would reduce the prices paid by British consumers by 10%, which in turn would drive an upturn in the economy (GDP).The 10% figure has been criticised. Researchers at the London School of Economics (LSE) said the figure “comes from looking at the differences in price levels between the UK and some other countries and arguing that these higher prices are due to protectionism caused mainly by EU regulations (non-tariff barriers).”However, this argument ignores the possibility that prices in EU markets may be higher for other reasons, for example because EU consumers buy better quality products.The LSE continues: “say Europeans put a higher premium on high-quality clothing compared with Americans. It will look like Europeans are paying more for their clothes, but in reality, the higher average prices simply reflect a different mix of purchases.”Also the data used by the EFT comes from 2002, meaning the estimates are quite out of date.The issue of “non-tariff barriers” has also been contestedEconomists have also challenged the EFT’s assumption that UK exporters would not face increased non-tariff barriers to trade with the EU if we left on WTO terms. The Institute for Government describes this assumption as “extreme”.Non-tariff barriers are things like regulatory standards which trading partners have to comply with. They can limit the amount of trade which two countries are able to do together.It is estimated that the non-tariff barriers faced by non-EU members exporting to the EU range from 7%-21% of the value of those goods (whereas members of the EU single market don’t face such barriers when trading with one another).The EFT acknowledges this, yet believes that UK exporters would not face new non-tariff barriers if the UK left the EU on WTO terms because WTO rules wouldn’t allow it. The Institute for Government says: “WTO law is not strong enough to compel the EU to abandon the legal requirements of the Single Market”, a finding supported by trade law experts. This would mean the UK would likely face significant non-tariff barriers on exports to the EU if it adopted the policy proposed by EFT.

","The EU hasn’t said Brexit will collapse the EU budget12th Jun 2019ClaimThe EU admits its budget will collapse without financial contribution from the UK.ConclusionIncorrect. The EU is preparing a draft budget for 2021-2027, involving increased contributions and decreased spending in some areas to account for the UK’s departure.A viral post on Facebook claims the EU has admitted its budget will collapse without UK contributions following Brexit. It’s incorrect.When we asked the European Commission (the body that proposes the budget) their spokesperson said the EU has not said this, and that claims that the EU would collapse because of the financial implications of Brexit were exaggerated.The claim may well originate in a 2017 Express article (which has a similarly worded headline) which reported on the fact that the EU would be left with a financial gap to fill.That’s because the UK is a net contributor to the EU budget, meaning it pays more into the budget than it receives back in the form of things like agricultural subsidies. The European Commission has also previously said that Brexit will leave a “sizeable gap” in its budget.The fact the EU has a budget gap to fill post-Brexit doesn’t mean it will collapse.While the next EU budget for 2021-2027 hasn’t been finalised, draft plans account for the UK leaving. The European Commission said:“The Commission’s proposal takes fair account of the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom, through a balanced combination of reductions/redeployments and an increase of expenditure (proportionally roughly 50% each).”A Commission spokesperson told us the provisional deadline to sign off the budget is in autumn this year.This article is part of our work factchecking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

11,fullfact,"There was a major increase in the number of “short” positions taken by UK hedge funds when Boris Johnson ran for Conservative leader.
","We think there's a big error in that viral article about hedge funds and Brexit12th Sep 2019ClaimThere was a major increase in the number of “short” positions taken by UK hedge funds when Boris Johnson ran for Conservative leader.ConclusionWe cannot identify any such increase; this seems to be an error caused by looking at incomplete data.An article in the Byline Times, which has been shared tens of thousands of times on social media, makes a series of claims about donors to Vote Leave and Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign standing to profit from a no deal Brexit.But at least one key part of the article—a claim that the number of “short positions” taken by hedge funds increased dramatically in the lead up to Boris Johnson’s election as Conservative leader—seems likely to be based on a misunderstanding of the data.In reality, no such spike in the number of short positions seems to have occurred.What is a “short position”? A “short position” is effectively a bet that the price of a particular share will fall in the near future.For example an investor or fund will borrow a number of shares in a company from another investor, typically paying them some interest for the privilege.They then sell those shares on to a third party.If the share price then falls, they can then buy the same number of shares for the new lower price, return them to the original investor they borrowed them from, and will have made a profit on the difference. A firm taking out such a short position has to register that with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) if the net value of the shares they are “shorting” exceeds 0.2% of the value of the company. Any shorting above 0.5% of the value of the company is made publicly available.The data doesn’t seem to show any spike A key premise of the Byline Times article is that the number of “short” positions taken out by UK firms dramatically increased after Boris Johnson announced his candidacy for the Conservative leadership, and reached a peak in the week that he was announced as the winner.We think they’ve made a mistake in this analysis: they only looked at the short positions that were still active at the time they gathered the data.By their nature, short positions may only last for a relatively brief period of time, after which the borrowed shares are returned. The data the FCA provides is split into two parts: “current”, which lists all the positions still active, and “historic”, which lists the positions where the transaction had ended or the number of shares being shorted has since changed.If you only look at the “current” data, then you’re obviously going to see a larger number of short positions in recent weeks compared to many months ago: the older positions will have ended or been altered since. We don’t know quite when Byline Times gathered the data they used, but using the most recent “current” data—going up to 8 September—produces a graph that looks very similar in shape to the one in their article:But if you include all the historical data as well, then you don’t see any such spike for the period covered by the Byline Times article:This apparent error has also been pointed out by several journalists on Twitter, including  Louis Goddard of Global Witness and Luke Bailey of the i.We asked Byline Times to share the data they used; they told us they would be publishing another article explaining their methodology, which they subsequently did. The article says they were “seeking to understand why” others could not replicate their findings.Byline Times suggested the reason may be because “Byline Times counted the number of position holders taking out positions, not the number of short positions” (despite the graphs in original article claiming they showed the “number of short positions”). They also said that they excluded all non-UK firms from their data. We don’t think that these factors are sufficient to explain the discrepancy; even just looking at a small number of UK firms and counting the number of position holders produces figures larger than some of the weeks shown in their graphs.We asked Byline Times to share the list of UK firms they were working from, and would suggest that doing so would help others assess their work.There are other questions about the article This is not the only potential issue with the article. The article also claims that the UK firms taking out those short positions were “almost entirely dominated” by firms that had either “directly, or through their directorships of other companies” donated to the Vote Leave campaign.We have asked Byline Times for more information on which firms they consider to have been direct or indirect Vote Leave donors; they told us they would not release this information for “legal reasons” because they had not contacted those firms. Their follow-up article does not detail the methodology they used to identify these firms as direct or indirect donors.The Financial Times has also raised a number of issues with the article, notably with the premise that a short position is necessarily a “bet on no deal” as the article suggests. For example, they point out that some companies would likely benefit from a no deal Brexit; shorting them would be effectively be betting against no deal.

12,fullfact,"The vast majority of the public strongly objects to the government’s plan to pay £39 billion to Brussels.
","Beer mat Brexit: do the facts stack up?31st Aug 2018ClaimThe vast majority of the public strongly objects to the government’s plan to pay £39 billion to Brussels.ConclusionA poll found that 75% of respondents said paying an EU exit fee of up to £40 billion was unacceptable. But responses to these questions depend on how the question is framed. Lawyers have repeatedly said that there is no legal obligation for the UK to pay to leave the EU. Some lawyers have said this, but there are differing legal views on the matter. The EU imposes taxes or “tariffs” on rice, oranges, coffee, wine, children’s clothes and other non-EU imports. Correct, though not all non-EU trade is subject to tariffs. The EU has arrangements—including trade deals—with non-EU countries that reduce or remove these tariffs. Ending tariffs means lower prices in shops and pubs. Not necessarily. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that a reduction in consumer prices from reducing tariffs would be wiped out by extra costs imposed by the UK leaving the EU customs union. People pay for tariffs set by the EU every time they shop—and the government collects the money and sends it to Brussels. Correct. A proportion of this money is then spent in the UK on EU-funded projects, though less than most other EU countries. 93% of the world is not in the EU. Correct, looking at the world’s population. About 78% of the world’s economic output is estimated to be outside of the EU. Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland and Canada have slashed tariffs—their citizens are better off as a result, and their economies have thrived. Uncertain. This is a very broad claim, and it is hard to attribute the performance of any economy to one factor such as reducing tariffs. The USA and India are keen to do trade deals with the UK. Correct.Claim 1 of 8 The pub chain JD Wetherspoon has recently distributed beer mats in its pubs making a number of claims about the EU and outlining what Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin thinks the UK government’s Brexit policy should be. These beer mats have also been the subject of a number of news articles.We were asked by Full Fact readers to see if these claims stack up.“Free Trade (ie “No Deal”) means lower prices” … “Ending tariffs means lower prices in shops and pubs!”The initial claim - that 'Free Trade' and 'No Deal' mean the same thing - is misleading. Exiting the EU without a deal wouldn't necessarily mean that the UK would adopt a particular trade policy afterwards; it would mean that the government would have the option to adopt it, within the constraints of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.There have been calls for the UK in a no-deal scenario to follow the lead of countries like Singapore to operate with few, if any, import tariffs. However, this is not currently government policy, and it's also possible that the government could choose to raise import duties following a no-deal Brexit.The UK government is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU, and the shape of the UK and the EU’s future relationship. The UK's aims include what it calls a “deep and comprehensive economic partnership”, with the EU, including establishing a “free trade area for goods”. At the moment, the UK is part of the EU Customs Union. This means we can’t face or impose tariffs (which are like taxes) on our trade with other countries in the customs union.The EU does set some tariffs on trade that comes in from the rest of the world, outside the customs union, which means some UK imports face tariffs too. That’s unless the EU has a specific trade agreement with the countries involved. It also waives tariffs on most goods from almost 50 developing countries under its Everything But Arms policy.If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal in place we would trade with the EU under the rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation: an international body which regulates world trade. This is what people mean by trading “under WTO terms” or a “no deal Brexit”.This means the UK could remove tariffs on some goods that currently face them via the EU.Ending tariffs wouldn’t necessarily lead to “lower prices in shops and pubs”It’s generally accepted that reducing tariffs in and of itself lowers consumer prices: after all, these are an additional tax on products.There’s inherent uncertainty to any predictions, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has estimated that abolishing tariffs entirely could reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7–1.2%.But tariffs are just one factor that impacts on the prices that consumers actually pay.        Removing tariffs like this is only possible if the UK leaves the EU’s customs union. Doing this would likely lead to the need for new checks on goods moving between the UK and the EU, which would introduce new costs on this trade.The IFS concludes that these new costs would probably be greater than the limited savings from abolishing tariffs: leading to higher costs for consumers.The UK government has recently published a series of guidance notes explaining how people should prepare for a no-deal Brexit, giving some clarity as to what these “non-tariff barriers” would look like. The trade guidance it has published suggests that businesses might consider buying new software or hiring “a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider” to help them navigate these new requirements. “The vast majority of the public strongly objects to the crazy government plan to pay £39 billion to Brussels, with nothing in return” … “That’s £600 for every man, woman and child in the UK—or £60 million per MP.”In a poll conducted by ICM on behalf of the Guardian in August 2017, respondents were asked whether they thought that “paying an ‘exit fee’ of up to £40bn … as the UK’s contribution to spending commitments made by the UK when the UK was a member” was acceptable or unacceptable. 75% said they thought it was unacceptable.Polling organisation YouGov has noted that people’s responses to this question seem to depend a lot on how the question is framed. Respondents tend to be more supportive of the lower figure in a range of options and less supportive of higher figures. In this case the £40 billion was the highest figure provided.The size of the UK’s “divorce bill” with the EU is estimated to be £35-39 billion. We’ve written more about that here. Dividing £39 billion by the population of the UK and the number of MPs does give you about “£600 for every man, woman and child in the UK — or £60 million per MP”.“Lawyers have repeatedly said that there is no legal obligation to pay [a Brexit divorce bill].”A House of Lords report has argued that legally the UK isn’t required to pay a penny. This has been disputed by some legal experts, and the report itself acknowledges that there are “competing interpretations”. The Institute for Government has suggested that, if the UK refused to pay the exit fee, the EU might seek redress through the International Court of Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration.“People pay these protectionist tariffs every time they shop – and the government collects the money and sends it to Brussels.”The UK Government collects tariff revenues on goods it imports from states that don’t have tariff-free trade with the EU, and contributes this to the EU budget, after keeping 20% of this money to cover “collection costs”. The UK then receives a proportion of its contribution to the EU budget back in EU-funded projects in the UK (just less than half in 2017), though less than many other member countries.  “… all EU products can be replaced by similar alternatives from the UK—or from the 93% of the world not in the EU.”This 93% figure seems to refer to the proportion of the world’s population that is in not in the EU, and is correct. Another way of considering this issue is the proportion of the world’s economic activity (measured in GDP) that is accounted for outside of the EU: an estimated 78% in 2016.Whether consumers would want to swap EU goods like champagne for English sparkling wine is a matter for them.“Our good friends in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland and Canada have slashed tariffs – their citizens are better off as a result, and their economies have thrived.”This isn’t a straightforward claim, and there’s no definitive way of measuring the impact that tariff changes might have had on those countries’ economies.Nor is there an easy way of summarising how low a country’s tariffs are, because they can vary a lot.One way to compare what sort of tariffs different countries charge on their imports is to compare their average World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs.This isn’t a perfect measure of how “free” a country’s trade is, as it doesn’t take account of any preferential trade agreements that individual countries or groups of countries have negotiated. In the case of the EU, for example, most trade takes place with countries that have negotiated improvements on these WTO rates.It also doesn’t tell you anything about trade in services. This isn’t subject to tariffs, but can face other non-tariff barriers to cross-border trade.Countries have two sets of tariffs: “bound tariffs” and “Most Favoured Nation” (MFN) tariffs. The bound tariff is the “upper bound”: the amount that countries have pledged to the WTO that they won’t exceed.The MFN tariffs are the ones that are generally used, and must be applied to all WTO members a trade agreement isn’t in place with. In WTO parlance this means that all countries are treated the same as the “Most Favoured Nation”. There can be a large discrepancy between these two figures.Hong Kong is the only place in the world to remove all of its tariffs, and in general, agricultural goods are subject to higher tariffs than other goods.Switzerland’s average MFN tariff, for example, is increased by the high tariffs it applies to agricultural products: on average 35%.Singapore’s average MFN tariff is zero, but this hides two details. One is that it retains a small average tariff on beverages and tobacco: 1.6%. The other is that it has a much higher average “bound tariff” of 9.4%: the level that the country can raise its tariffs to without breaking WTO rules. “And our good friends in countries like the USA and India are keen to do trade deals with us.”Both the USA and India have expressed interest in agreeing trade deals with the UK. These will be complex to negotiate and will require the UK government to make trade-offs.For example, in a trade deal with the US, how much would the UK want to coordinate the two countries' very different regulatory systems (the prospect of chlorine-washed chicken for sale in the UK is often raised as a concern by UK consumers)? And in a trade deal with India, would the UK want to ease immigration rules for Indian workers?   It is generally thought that new trade deals will take the UK several years, at the very least, to negotiate. The more these trade deals seek to do—for example, the more non-tariff barriers they seek to eliminate—the longer they will take.--Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact                     By Robin Wilkinson                  Share this:FacebookTwitterWe aim for our fact checks to be as accurate and up-to-date as possible.

But Ms Burley was incorrect to say that Norway is not in the single market. It is their place in the single market that means they follow freedom of movement rules.What is the single market?The single market refers the trading area in the EU. EU states are members and have to follow all the market’s rules, principally the free movement of goods, people, services and capital.In addition, members of the European Economic Area (EEA) align their rules to the single market and so are essentially part of it. This includes Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020, but remains a member of the single market during the transition period.Is Norway in the single market?Norway is part of the single market, which is why it follows the four freedoms. Ms Burley was wrong to suggest otherwise.Later in the interview, Ms Burley seemed to correct herself by saying, “Norway are not in the European Union, as I’ve said, and they have free movement of people.” This statement is true. Norway is not in the EU. It is only in the single market.Brexit with free movementMs Abbott is correct to say that once the UK leaves the single market, freedom of movement no longer applies.After Ms Burley corrects herself and suggests she has been referring to the EU, and not the single market, all along, Ms Abbott then changes her previously correct statement, saying “once we actually leave the EU, freedom of movement falls.”This is technically incorrect. The UK has already left the EU and still has freedom of movement.The UK could also keep free movement of people with the EU after the end of the transition period, as part of a future trade deal with the EU.However this is not and has never been the government’s plan.

Between 1973 and 2018 the UK’s net contribution to the EU was £216 billion in real terms.Lots of Full Fact readers have asked us to check a number of posts on social media which have claimed that “the economic cost of Brexit now exceeds what we’ve net paid-in to the EU over 47 years”.While it’s difficult to put a single, definitive figure on the economic impact of Brexit, these claims don’t currently add up. They are based on figures which actually show the UK’s net contributions are higher than an estimated economic cost so far.Other reports have made a more defensible claim: that Brexit will “have soon cost” or “is set to cost” the UK more than 47 years of payments to the EU budget. But these still depend on accepting an uncertain estimate for the cost of Brexit so far, plus even more uncertain estimates of the future cost. And even then, the figure at the end of 2020 is still slightly lower.The claims are based on analysis by Bloomberg Economics which found that the “economic cost” of Brexit to the UK was £130 billion by the end of 2019. This looks at how much lower GDP is in real terms than it otherwise might have been had previous trends (from before the vote to leave the EU) continued between 2016 and 2019.This “cost”, according to the analysis, is set to rise to £200 billion by the end of 2020.To put that in context, the whole UK economy was worth about £2,144 billion—or £2.1 trillion—in 2018.Following the publication of the analysis these figures were then compared on social media (not by Bloomberg) to the UK’s total net contributions to the EU.Bloomberg Economics told us that the £200 billion figure it came up with was an estimate, as it’s impossible to be sure what the economy would have looked like if the UK had voted to remain in the EU in 2016. Many different estimates have been done of the impact of Brexit on the UK, as we’ve written about before.We haven’t looked in detail at Bloomberg Economics’ calculations, but it’s already clear that its estimates are still less than the UK’s net contributions to the EU.At the moment we only have figures on what the UK has contributed to the EU up to the end of 2018, so covering 45 years rather than 47. These have been gathered by the House of Commons Library. In that time the UK’s net contribution to the EU between 1973 and 2018 was about £216 billion in real terms (accounting for the way prices change over time and using 2019 prices). The net contribution was £156 billion in cash terms (not accounting for inflation).Both of these contribution figures are higher than the “economic cost of Brexit” estimated by Bloomberg Economics up to the end of 2019. The real terms figure of EU contributions (the more meaningful of the two) is still higher than the “cost of Brexit” estimated up to the end of 2020.If you estimate what the UK will have paid in net contributions by 2020, using the latest figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility on the financial settlement with the EU, then it comes to around £222 billion in real terms.

15,fullfact,"Dettol antiseptic spray says it kills coronavirus.
","Dettol hasn’t tested its products against the new Wuhan coronavirus yet17th Feb 2020ClaimDettol antiseptic spray says it kills coronavirus.ConclusionThat is correct but that doesn’t refer to the new coronavirus (Covid-19) identified in Wuhan. Coronavirus is a large category of viruses that includes the common cold. Dettol has said its products haven’t been tested against the new virus yet. Coronavirus isn’t dangerous as it can be killed by Dettol products. How dangerous the novel coronavirus is doesn’t relate to whether disinfectants work against it. Coronavirus is a large category of viruses that includes the common cold. Dettol has said its products haven’t been tested against the new virus yet.Claim 1 of 2A Facebook post shows an image claiming that Dettol spray can kill coronavirus and that it was known about in 2019. It has been shared over 10,000 times on Facebook. Another shows an image of a Dettol bottle and asks “if Corona virus is so new and so dangerous how come dettol can kill it?” It has been shared over 7,000 times.The implication is that the new coronavirus observed in China is not new, or that it is not very dangerous if Dettol can kill it.Both images are of genuine bottles of Dettol, as we’ve written before, and a number of Dettol products say they are proven to kill “Human Coronavirus”.But the key point here is that coronavirus is a broad category of viruses which includes a number of different respiratory illnesses. One is the common cold, but the category also includes SARS (the severe acute respiratory syndrome of which there were outbreaks in 2002 and 2004), and the new coronavirus identified in Wuhan. The “Human coronavirus” referred to on the Dettol bottle is not the same as the new one (recently named Covid-19 by the World Health Organisation.)The new coronavirus has not been tested with commercial cleaning sprays yet to see whether or not it can be killed by them.As for how dangerous the new Covid-19 virus can be, the World Health Organisation has said: “As with other respiratory illnesses, infection with [Covid-19] can cause mild symptoms including a runny nose, sore throat, cough, and fever. It can be more severe for some persons and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal.” The isn’t necessarily a link between how dangerous a virus is to those infected with it, and whether disinfectants are effective against it. For example, one study in Nature suggests that Dettol is effective against Ebola, although Dettol don’t make that claim themselves. Covid-19 spreads primarily through person-to-person contact, such as “respiratory droplets generated when a person, for example, coughs or sneezes”—so the most common route of infection isn’t via surfaces that could be cleaned with such products.What has Dettol said?Dettol has issued information about the Covid-19 coronavirus. It says the new virus “is not yet available for commercial testing.” It also claims that a number of its products have proven effective against other types of coronavirus.It adds: “Given the structural similarities of the novel 2019-CoV virus to the coronavirus strains tested previously (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Human Coronavirus), and based on the evidence available to us, we would expect our Dettol products (listed above) to be effective against the new strain. Definitive scientific confirmation of this, as with all other commercially available virucides, can only be provided once testing against 2019-nCoV Coronavirus has been conducted, following release of the strain by relevant health authorities.”This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here. For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as partly false because although the Dettol spray does mention coronavirus, that’s a whole family of respiratory viruses, including the common cold, as well as this new coronavirus virus from Wuhan. We also can’t yet know if products like Dettol are effective against the new virus as they’ve not yet been tested. The fact that coronavirus is listed on the back of Dettol products doesn’t mean the company knew about the new Wuhan coronavirus last year, as is suggested by the posts.                     By Claire Milne                  Share this:FacebookTwitterWe aim for our fact checks to be as accurate and up-to-date as possible.

","There's no evidence that the 2019 coronavirus originated in a Chinese government laboratory17th Feb 2020ClaimScientists believe that coronavirus may have come from bats in a Chinese research facility.ConclusionTwo Chinese scientists have published an article suggesting that the 2019 coronavirus outbreak could have originated from bats in a laboratory in Wuhan. However, apart from maps showing the proximity of laboratories, they offer no evidence to prove this.“Did coronavirus originate in Chinese government laboratory? Scientists believe killer disease may have begun in research facility 300 yards from Wuhan wet fish market”MailOnline, 16 February 2020“THE coronavirus could have spread from a Wuhan laboratory which housed 600 bats which attacked and “peed on” scientists, experts say.”The Sun, 16 February 2020Several newspapers have reported on claims by Chinese scientists that the current coronavirus (Covid-19) may have originated in bats kept in a Chinese government laboratory in Wuhan.The reports are of a real paper published by Chinese scientists, but it’s important to understand the context. The paper hasn’t been peer reviewed, and it doesn’t offer any clear evidence that the outbreak began in a lab. It simply proposes it as a possibility.The paper also doesn’t support claims that the virus was artificially created.What does the paper say?The scientists wrote about the possible pathways between infected bats (which have been identified as the possible origins of the disease) and the seafood market where Covid-19 outbreak reportedly began.The authors concluded that two discussed pathways that may have led to infected bats in the market were improbable.The first is that the bats flew to the market from their natural habitat. They doubted this, saying that the bats carrying the virus are found more than 900 kilometres away from Wuhan. It seems fair to say that Wuhan is not the natural habitat of this particular bat species.The second pathway that they discuss is that the bats were sold in the market and eaten as food. They say that, according to local reports, bats are not eaten in Wuhan.The researchers suggest that research facilities close to the seafood market may be the missing link.Using online maps, the authors conclude that there are laboratories conducting research on bats about 280 metres and 12 kilometres from the market. The authors cite research papers coming out of both labs as evidence.The paper doesn’t provide any evidence beyond the mapsFirstly, while a pre-print of this paper has been published (a pre-print is an early draft that has not yet been peer reviewed) it is unclear whether this paper will be published in a research journal and therefore whether it has been reviewed by other academics.Also the research doesn’t provide any evidence that the bats held in the Wuhan laboratories had Covid-19. The papers written on research conducted in the lab 280m from the seafood market were not on any type of coronavirus. The paper written on research conducted in the lab 12km from the market was on a coronavirus, but not Covid-19. (Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that infect many species, of which Covid-19 is just one.)And this is not the only plausible theory for how Covid-19 infected humans. The researchers do not discuss the theory that Covid-19 spread from bats to an intermediary animal and then to humans.They state in the paper that “solid proofs are needed in future study”.It’s worth noting that the researchers suggest that Covid-19 spread to humans from bats naturally carrying the coronavirus. There is no evidence or suggestion in the paper that Covid-19 was artificially created in a lab.

18,fullfact,"Wuhan is where 5G was rolled out first.
","The Wuhan coronavirus has nothing to do with 5G29th Jan 2020ClaimWuhan is where 5G was rolled out first.ConclusionWuhan was one of the first places with 5G trials, as well as several other large Chinese cities, like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou but we don’t know if it was the first. 5G wrecks immune systems and that is why people in Wuhan are suffering with this illness. There is no evidence that 5G can harm humans, or their immune systems. The Wuhan coronavirus is a more virulent version of the normal cold. The new coronavirus observed in Wuhan is a virus in the same family of viruses as the common cold, but is a different illness.Claim 1 of 3A post on Facebook claims that Wuhan, China, the centre of the new coronavirus outbreak, was where 5G was first rolled out. It suggests that 5G has damaged peoples’ immune systems and so boosted the virulence of the common cold. The main implication of the claim—that 5G can impact immune systems—is totally unfounded. There is no evidence linking the new coronavirus to 5G.It’s true that Wuhan does have some 5G coverage. The local government listed a number of venues with 5G coverage in August 2019. We can’t find evidence it was the very first city with 5G but we’ve seen reports saying Wuhan was one of several Chinese cities where early 5G trials took place. Another said Wuhan was “one of the first pilot cities of the 5G network in China”.In October 2019, China’s three state telecoms companies announced they would be rolling out phone services that use 5G, and that big cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hangzhou were already covered by the network.As we’ve written about before, there is no evidence that 5G is harmful to humans. 5G is the next generation of wireless network technology, following on from 4G. Like 4G, 3G and 2G before it, 5G mobile data is transmitted over radio waves—a small part of the whole electromagnetic spectrum (which includes microwaves, visible light and X-rays).These radio waves are non-ionising, meaning they don’t damage the DNA inside cells, as X-rays, gamma rays and UV rays are able to do. 5G, although at slightly higher frequencies than previous networks, is still in this radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum.Public Health England has said that there’s no “convincing evidence” that exposure below International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation guidelines can cause adverse health effects. These guidelines go up to 300GHz, whereas the maximum for 5G will probably only be in the tens of GHz.There is no evidence that 5G can damage the immune system.As for the claim that the new coronavirus observed in Wuhan is the “normal cold” with boosted virulence—that is simply not the case.As we’ve discussed in other fact checks, although the new coronavirus spreading in Wuhan has commonly been referred to by the media and others as just “coronavirus”, it is just one type within this family of viruses.Coronavirus is a broad category of viruses which includes the common cold, SARS (the severe acute respiratory syndrome of which there were outbreaks in 2002 and 2004) and this new coronavirus identified in people in Wuhan.This article is part of our work factchecking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

","The World Health Organisation did not know about the Covid-19 virus before the current outbreak18th Feb 2020ClaimScientists knew about the new coronavirus long ago and called it “Disease X”.ConclusionThey didn’t. This is a misunderstanding about the phrase “Disease X”, which the WHO used to denote an unknown serious new disease that might cause a pandemic.“Did scientists know about coronavirus before outbreak? 'Disease X' warning revealed”The Daily Express , 17 February 2020A report on the Daily Express’s website could cause confusion about the origins of Covid-19, the new coronavirus that has caused an outbreak  in China recently.In its original version, the article’s headline promised to explain, “How scientists knew about illness and dubbed it 'Disease X' before outbreak”. This has since been changed into a question asking whether or not scientists knew about the new disease before the outbreak.The subheading previously said: “it has emerged that scientists knew about the deadly virus long ago”. That now reads “it has emerged that scientists warned about a new deadly virus long ago”.Both versions either state or heavily imply that the World Health Organisation (WHO) already knew about Covid-19 before the recent outbreak.  It didn’t. As the article itself goes on to say (and as a previous Express article said last year) “Disease X” is not the name of a specific illness. It is simply a phrase that the WHO uses to represent “the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease”. In other words, it’s just a made-up name being used as a stand-in for any unknown disease.The fact that the WHO was talking about “Disease X” in 2018 does not mean that it knew about Covid-19. It means they were aware that some kind of new disease might emerge in future, just as Covid-19 has.The article quotes comments made in an Observer article by Dr Josie Golding, Epidemics Lead at the Wellcome Trust. Dr Golding told Full Fact, “Disease X does not refer to a specific pathogen. It is a term given to any as-yet unknown disease with the potential to cause a serious epidemic.”Update 19 February 2020Updated to include comment from Dr. Josie Golding.

","These aren’t satellite images and they don’t show evidence of mass cremations in Wuhan13th Feb 2020ClaimSatellite images showing high levels of sulphur dioxide above China are possible evidence of mass cremations of people who have died from coronavirus.ConclusionFalse. The maps are not satellite images, and do not show actual levels of sulphur dioxide. They are simply forecasts based on historical data and weather patterns.“Chilling satellite pics ‘show extent of corpse burning in Wuhan’”The Sun, 10 February 2020“Coronavirus satellite image: Does THIS image show REAL scale of virus cremations?”The Express, 10 February 2020Multiple newspapers have claimed that satellite maps showing very high levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2) in areas of China affected by the new coronavirus may indicate the mass burning of dead bodies.For example, The Sun reported that “Satellite maps in recent days have detected alarming levels of SO2 around Wuhan”, while Metro wrote that “The sheer scale of the number of bodies being cremated in China after the coronavirus outbreak can be judged by the cloud of sulphur dioxide that has appeared above affected cities, it has been claimed.”These claims are wrong. The maps the claims are based on are not satellite images, and they do not show real, observed data on current levels of sulphur dioxide. NASA, which provided the data in the first place, told Full Fact that they are simply forecasts based on weather patterns and historical information about SO2 emissions.Where the claim comes fromThe claims originated on social media, including one particularly viral Twitter thread. They suggest that an apparent surge in SO2 levels above Wuhan and Chongqing, both cities affected by the outbreak of the new Covid-19 coronavirus, could be evidence of mass cremations, on the grounds that SO2 is released when a corpse is burned.They are based on screenshots from a weather forecast site called Windy.com. In addition to standard weather forecast features, Windy offers options to display predictions for levels of various pollutants, such as particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide. The screenshots are of the sulphur dioxide three day forecasts for the Wuhan area from the weekend beginning Saturday, 8 February (you can see the equivalent current forecast here).But (as was pointed out in a thread on Reddit) that’s all they are: forecasts. They don’t show what actually happened.The data doesn’t include real-time observationsWindy.com says that the SO2 forecast uses data from NASA’s GEOS-5 atmospheric modelling system. Dr. Arlindo M da Silva, a research meteorologist from NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, told Full Fact that the GEOS-5 sulphur dioxide models do not “assimilate real satellite data” into their forecasts, but instead are based on past evidence of emission levels.“Our forecasts are based on fixed emission inventories,” he wrote in an email. “Although satellite data has been used in the construction of the emission inventories, these emissions do not account for the day-to-day variations in SO2 emissions and as such cannot account for sudden changes in human activity. In GEOS-5, day-to-day variations in SO2 are due to variations in the meteorological conditions, in particular winds.”In other words, the maps in question are not based on any real-time observations; instead they are simply predictions based on weather patterns. As such they could not possibly show an unexpected event such as a mass cremation.

","The virus in this clinical study is not the coronavirus seen in China in 2019/202028th Jan 2020ClaimA vaccine for the coronavirus was being trialled in January 2020 days before the outbreak.ConclusionIncorrect. The trial referenced was for a different type of coronavirus—Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).A Facebook post claiming that a vaccine trial for the Wuhan coronavirus started days before the recent outbreak has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook.However, the post makes several incorrect claims.Firstly, the vaccine trial referenced does not relate to the virus behind the recent outbreak, but a different one altogether. While the virus observed in Wuhan, China has commonly been referred to as simply “coronavirus”, this is actually a term for a family of viruses that can infect a range of species. The vaccine in the clinical trial linked to in the post is for a coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).The most recent virus, currently known simply as “2019 novel coronavirus” (2019-nCoV), is a different virus. Multiple efforts to develop a vaccine for 2019-nCoV are currently underway, but none are at trial stage yet.Secondly, the vaccine in the trial referenced to was replication-deficient, meaning it was engineered by scientists to be unable to spread through the body and infect the host.Additionally, the location of the vaccine trial is listed as Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which is 4,000 miles away from Wuhan, where the first 2019-nCoV outbreak was identified. And (as the name suggests) the 2019-nCoV outbreak was first observed at the end of 2019, before the date the MERS vaccine trial was due to start.This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

24,fullfact,"Two authors predicted the coronavirus decades before the outbreak.
","Here’s what the books that “predicted” the Covid-19 coronavirus actually say21st Feb 2020ClaimTwo authors predicted the coronavirus decades before the outbreak.ConclusionA 1980s sci-fi novel describes a disease called “Wuhan-400” that bears little similarity to the new Wuhan coronavirus. A book of “prophecies about the end of the world” written in 2008 predicted that a pneumonia-like illness would spread across the world in the year 2020.The Daily Star has claimed that two authors predicted the outbreak of the novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China.A number of Facebook posts have implied the same.One of the books mentioned is “The Eyes of Darkness”, a science fiction novel written by Dean Koontz and published in 1981.The book references a fictional “biological weapon” called “Wuhan-400” that was designed to kill people but inadvertently gives one child psychic abilities.The real coronavirus in Wuhan (technically known as “SARS-CoV-2”, which causes the disease now known as “Covid-19”) and this fictional weapon have little in common, bar that they both have some association with the Chinese city of Wuhan. In the book, the fictional disease was developed at “labs outside the city of Wuhan”. The real outbreak of Covid-19 is believed to have originated in the city.As we’ve written about before, there’s no evidence that Covid-19 was artificially created, or originated from a lab.Other characteristics of “Wuhan-400” don’t match Covid-19. The book says that “Once infected, no one lives more than twenty-four hours” and that its “kill-rate is one hundred percent”, something that is not true of Covid-19, which has a fatality rate of around 2%.The book also says that it “afflicts only human beings” and that “no other living creature can carry it”, while Covid-19 is believed to have crossed over into humans from bats, possibly via a third animal. And Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, while the book’s disease affects the brain stem, where it “begins secreting a toxin that literally eats away brain tissue like battery acid dissolving cheesecloth.”The other book the Daily Star mentions is called “End of Days: Predictions and prophecies about the end of the world” co-written by “psychic and spiritual teacher” Sylvia Browne, and published in 2008.It claims: “In around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments.”It’s worth noting that, while there is not yet a vaccine for the Covid-19 coronavirus, the human immune system does fight the disease. As noted, most victims survive. Trials of vaccines and other potential treatments are currently underway.It’s also worth noting that this prediction was made just a few years after the (closely related) SARS outbreak, and that it comes amidst some of the book’s other health predictions—which include claiming a cure for “paralysis and Parkinson’s disease [will be found] no later than 2012”, and the assertion that “blindness will become a thing of the past by 2020”.

25,fullfact,"A man was fined £50 for burning poppies.
","Two men did go to prison for throwing bacon at a mosque, while a man was fined for burning poppies18th Feb 2020ClaimA man was fined £50 for burning poppies.ConclusionThis is true. Emdadur Choudhury was fined after burning poppies in 2011. Mr Choudhury’s fine was paid out of his benefits. It was reported at the time that Mr Choudhury received benefits and had a part-time job. We don’t know who paid the fine. Two men were sentenced to eight months in prison for throwing bacon at a mosque. Mateusz Pawlikowski and Piotr Czak-Zukowski were both sentenced to two eight-month sentences, to run concurrently, for criminal damage and a racial/religious public order offence after verbally abusing and throwing bacon at a worshipper in a mosque.Claim 1 of 3A post comparing the sentencing of three men for two different crimes has been shared thousands of times.   The post says that a man who burned poppies was fined £50, which was paid from his benefits, and that he laughed at this sentence. It compares this to two men who it says were sentenced to eight months in jail for throwing bacon at a mosque.It is true that Emdadur Choudhury was fined £50 for offences under the Public Order Act after he burnt three poppies on Remembrance Day 2011 as part of a counter-protest. He was also ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge.It was widely reported at the time that, according to his defence, Mr Choudhury received £792 pounds in monthly government benefits on top of £480 in monthly wages. It’s not clear whether he paid the fine himself, as in several interviews afterwards he claimed that radical preacher  Anjem Choudhury had offered to pay.It’s also unclear if Mr Choudhury “laughed” at his sentencing in court, but the same article in the Mail says he laughed following his trial when asked if he’d do it again.Then-Prime Minister David Cameron implied he felt Choudhury’s sentence was too lenient. At the time, the maximum fine for this was an £1000.The post also says that two men who “threw bacon at [a] mosque” were sentenced to eight months in jail. This is also a real case, although that account does not fully describe what they were accused of.The two men, Mateusz Pawlikowski and Piotr Czak-Zukowski, were both sentenced to two eight-month sentences for criminal damage and a racial/religious public order offence. These were to run concurrently, meaning the two sentences are served simultaneously. The men were said to have entered the mosque and thrown bacon at an attendee, as well as around the venue and in worshipper’s shoes. They also verbally abused the man.This article is part of our work factchecking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

27,fullfact,"British OAPs who have worked for 45 years get a total yearly benefit of £6,000.
","This image on benefits for pensioners and refugees is not correct13th Feb 2020ClaimBritish OAPs who have worked for 45 years get a total yearly benefit of £6,000.ConclusionA British pensioner with 45 years’ worth of national insurance contributions is likely to get at least £700 a year more than this, and be eligible for more benefits on top. Refugees or illegal immigrants living in Britain get a total yearly benefit of £29,900. Illegal immigrants cannot collect benefits. Refugees can on the same basis as UK nationals once their request for asylum is granted—but this figure is unusually high.Claim 1 of 2An image claiming that ‘illegal immigrants’ and refugees can claim a much larger yearly benefits than British pensioners has been shared more than 90,000 times on Facebook. The text says in part: “If they worked for 45 years…BRITISH OLD AGED PENSIONER’S GET A TOTAL YEARLY BENEFIT OF £6,000. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS / REFUGEES LIVING IN BRITAIN GET A TOTAL YEARLY BENEFIT OF £29,900”.We’ve factchecked a similar set of viral claims on the benefits that pensioners and refugees are eligible for numerous times over many years. The figures on this page are an update of the figures in these older factchecks.British pensioners who have worked for 45 years are likely to get a minimum payout of £6,700 a year, not including other benefits. ‘Illegal immigrants’ don’t get anything: those who are staying in the country illegally aren’t eligible for benefits. People in the process of applying for asylum may be eligible for a cash payment or housing, but can’t claim most benefits. Refugees (those whose asylum applications have been successful) can claim the same benefits as UK nationals, but the figure quoted is unrealistically high.The claim has a long history that spans multiple countries. In 2015, the House of Commons Library wrote about a similar claim circulated via email that quoted the same figures with slightly different accompanying text. The library said “The figures quoted bear no relation whatsoever to the situation in the United Kingdom”. The House of Commons Library said the claim may have originated from a similar message circulated in Australia. The government there subsequently debunked it, but there have also been similar versions in Canada and India with some details changed.How much can these groups actually collect?The image claims that pensioners working 45 years receive £6,000 in “total yearly benefit”. Pensioners who have made 30-35 years of national insurance contributions receive more than this through the state pension alone. This doesn’t include any other benefits they may benefit from including winter fuel payments, means-tested benefits like pension credit, and a free TV license.If the pensioner in this example is a man born before 6 April 1951 or a woman born before 6 April 1953, they can claim the basic state pension. A full basic state pension is £129.20 a week, which amounts to around £6,700 per year. People need to have 30 years of national insurance payments to qualify for this full amount. This excludes any top ups to the state pension.If the pensioner was born after those dates, they can claim the new state pension, which is £168.60 in full, which per year is around £8,800. People need to have 35 years of national insurance payments to qualify for this full amount. This excludes any protected payments, which is extra money older workers entitled to the new state pension may have amassed under the old system.What can ‘illegal immigrants’ claim?People who are staying in the UK illegally cannot claim any benefits.In its debunking paper for the email, the House of Commons Library defines illegal immigrants as those who entered the UK unlawfully or stayed in the country once their visa had expired.Those in the UK without legal status are likely to be removed if their immigration status is discovered by the authorities. They inherently do not have the right to work in the UK and we don’t have figures for those that do so anyway.As a result of the Welfare Reform Act 2012, only people with the right to work in the UK can collect national insurance contribution-based benefits like jobseeker’s and employment and support allowance, and work-related benefits like statutory maternity pay.People subject to immigration control (who require leave to remain in the UK but don’t have it) are also prevented from collecting payments like housing and child benefit, and universal credit.What can refugees claim?The term refugees usually refers to asylum seekers whose applications for asylum have been successful. According to a House of Commons research briefing, refugees “are able to claim social security benefits and tax credits on the same basis as UK nationals”.The £29,900 figure quoted in the image is unusually high—the benefits cap means the maximum payment of certain types of benefits to a couple or single person with children in London is £23,000 per household. Some people are not affected by the benefits cap, for example, people getting Universal Credit because of a disability or health condition that stops them working.Refugees in this image may refer to asylum seekers who are still awaiting a decision on their asylum application to remain here. To be eligible for asylum, someone must be unable to live safely in their country out of fear of persecution because of characteristics like race, religion or political opinions that put them at risk there.Asylum seekers who are waiting for a decision are not allowed to claim mainstream non-contributory social security benefits, and are not usually allowed to work either.But they may be eligible for asylum support from the Home Office if they are destitute, which the House of Commons library described as “less generous than social security benefits” in a briefing.This support can consist of somewhere to live (which they cannot choose and is unlikely to be in London or the South East), plus £37.75 per person in the household a week. We’ve written more about what asylum seekers can claim here.This article is part of our work factchecking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here. For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as partly false because while certain refugees could be eligible for more benefits than pensioners, the figures in the claim are wrong, and it is incorrect to suggest illegal immigrants can claim any benefits at all.

","Prisoners don’t have to pay the TV licence whereas from June 2020 most pensioners will11th Feb 2020ClaimPensioners have had free TV taken away.ConclusionThis is partially correct. About two thirds of people over 75 who currently have a free TV licence will have to pay for it after June 2020. Prisoners in the UK can watch TV all day for free. Prisoners rewarded for good behaviour can have a TV in their prison cell. Prisoners are exempt from the TV licence fee, but a rental charge of £1 per cell per week applies.Claim 1 of 2An image claiming that prisoners can watch TV all day for free, but pensioners have had their free TV taken away, has been shared on Facebook more than 250,000 times.This post refers to the announcement last year that TV licences will no longer be free for all people over 75. This was a widely discussed issue and we’ve written about it before here.A TV licence is a fee for watching live TV, as well as on demand and catch-up TV through BBC iPlayer, in the UK and currently costs £154.50 per household annually. About 4.6 million households received a free over-75s TV licence in 2018/19, funded by the UK government.From June 2020, free TV licences will only apply to people over 75 who receive Pension Credit. The BBC estimates that around 1.5 million households will be eligible once the changes are made, which is about one third of households that qualify under current rules.Prisoners who have been rewarded for good behaviour can get a TV in their cell. This allows access to nine free-to-view channels for a weekly TV rental fee of £1 per cell per week. Not paying this fee or bad behaviour are two reasons why a TV may be taken away.This fee does not include the TV licence fee as TVs used by prisoners in cells and communal prison areas are exempt from this charge.This article is part of our work factchecking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here. For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as true because while prisoners do have to pay a TV rental fee to watch TV in their cells, they do not have to pay a TV licence fee, as will be the case for most over 75s from June 2020.

29,fullfact,"The population of Britain is 51 million.
","The figures in this post give an inaccurate view of Britain11th Feb 2020ClaimThe population of Britain is 51 million.ConclusionThe population of the UK in mid-2018 was 66.4 million. 21 million people in Britain are retired. We don’t know for certain but a maximum of around 11.8 million people in the UK are retired. 19 million people are at school. The number of school pupils in the UK is around 10 million. Two million people are unemployed. 1.3 million people are unemployed in the UK. Four million people are employed by the government. 5.4 million people were recorded as working in the public sector across the UK in September 2019, of which 3.2 million are employed by central government. Three million people work in local counties and boroughs. Two million people were recorded as working in local government across the UK in September 2019. One million people are in the armed forces. There are around 193,000 UK armed forces personnel, of which 132,000 are full-time trained personnel. 620,000 people are in hospital. There is no clear measurement of how many people are in hospital at one time, however, figures that give an indication are significantly lower than this. 379,998 people are in prison. The prison population of the UK was 92,500 in 2018. The British workforce is two people. 32 million people were estimated to be in work in 2019.Claim 1 of 10A Facebook post that makes a series of claims about the British population has been shared by multiple accounts hundreds of times. The post is obviously intended to be humorous and has been understood as such by most of the commenters. It’s also been circulating online for decades.However, some readers do seem to have taken the post seriously so, to set the record straight, all the figures in the post are inaccurate. The post claims that the population of the UK is 51 million. In mid-2018 the population was 66.4 million. The post claims that 21 million people in Britain are retired. We don’t know the exact figure but it isn’t this high. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that there are 10.7 million people in the UK aged 65 or above who are “economically inactive” (meaning they are not working or seeking work due to things like retirement and ill health).Also, there are 1.1 million people aged under 65 who have taken early retirement. That means there is a maximum of 11.8 million retired people in the UK.   The post says that 19 million people are in school when it’s actually around 10 million and it also says that there are two million unemployed people when there are 1.3 million. The post claims that four million people are employed by the government and that three million are employed by counties and borough councils. 5.4 million people are employed in the public sector, of which 3.2 million are employed by central government and two million by local government.The post also claims that there are one million people in Britain’s armed forces which is a big exaggeration—there are around 193,000 personnel in the armed forces, of which 132,000 are full-time trained personnel. The post claims 620,000 people are in hospital, but statistics aren’t published on this so there’s no way of knowing for sure. What we can say is that on 113,000 overnight beds and 11,000 day-only beds were occupied in the English NHS according to the latest data from April to June 2019. The post claims that there are 379,998 people in prison. The figure is actually much lower, with 92,500 people recorded in prison in 2018.The post then humorously claims this means the workforce in the UK is two people; in September to November 2019 the ONS recorded just over 32 million people in employment in the UK, just under half of the population.
