0,fullfact,"Men may be taken to court and face serious sentences if they whistle at a woman and she calls the police, if proposals to count misogyny as a hate crime go ahead.
","“But the proposals [from campaigners] are so far ranging that lads could be dragged before courts and face serious sentences if they whistle at a woman and she calls police.” Daily Star, 10 July 2018  Proposals to add misogyny as a category of hate crime will not make anything illegal if it’s not already. Instead, crimes where the motivation is perceived to be the fact that the victim is a woman could result in harsher sentences. There have been several reports in the media that wolf whistling is to be categorised as a hate crime in the UK. This is because gender equality campaigners and religious leaders signed an open letter asking the National Police Chiefs’ Council to vote to “record misogyny as a hate crime”. Misogyny is a hatred of or prejudice against women. Nottinghamshire police started categorising cases where someone is targeted because they are a woman as a hate crime back in 2016. North Yorkshire Police followed in 2017. Wolf whistling will not be illegal under these proposals. Nothing currently legal would become illegal. The police in England, Wales and Northern Ireland classify a hate crime as a “criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice” based on someone’s actual or perceived race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or them being transgender. These are the minimum five types of hate crime the police have to record. According to the College of Policing, police forces are “free to extend their own [hate crime] policy response to include the hostilities that they believe are prevalent in their area or that are causing the greatest concern to the community”. Nottinghamshire police added misogyny to the characteristics that might motivate a hate crime, and that’s what campaigners are now asking the police to roll out nationally. This would also affect the categorisation of hate incidents, which are “non-crime incidents” motivated by “hostility or prejudice” from those listed above, where nothing illegal is deemed to have happened. Because of this, it seems unlikely that wolf whistling would lead to a prosecution, unless it was part of a wider case of illegal abusive behaviour. Wolf whistling could potentially be recorded as a hate incident, as the act itself is not illegal. You can read more about how hate crimes differ from hate incidents in our factcheck. Categorising something as a hate crime means that if the person is convicted, the Crown Prosecution Service can apply for what’s called an uplift, which can lead to a harsher sentence. More than half of successful hate crime prosecutions in 2016/17 had successfully uplifted sentences. Any crime “perceived, by the victim or any other person” to be motivated by certain hostilities or prejudices can be classed as a hate crime and potentially qualify for an uplift. Examples given by the police include robbery, harassment, criminal damage, and assault. Between April 2016 (when Nottinghamshire Police added misogyny to their definition) and March 2018, they recorded a total of 174 misogynistic hate crimes and incidents. In that time there had been one conviction. The vast majority of hate crime in England and Wales is racially motivated. Out of the 80,400 offences recorded in 2016/17 where one of the hate crime characteristics were a “motivating factor”, just under 80% were race hate crimes, although crimes can have more than one motivating factor. Over half of hate crime offences in 2016/17 took the form of public order offences, such as harassment or using threatening words and behaviour. A third involved violence against a person. Around 10% were criminal damage or other notifiable offences, like sexual offences or theft. Update 13 July 2018  We've clarified where we're talking about the UK as a whole and about England and Wales specifically. Correction 29 January 2019  We corrected a typo in the graph so it now reads ""Violence against the person"".","Even if rules do change on categorising hate crimes, wolf whistling in isolation would likely be classified as a hate incident, rather than crime, as it is not illegal. So wolf whistling alone is unlikely to result in prosecution.

"," “We’ve seen 40% cuts to the prison and criminal justice system.” Rachel Shabi, 6 February 2020 The journalist Rachel Shabi claimed during a Question Time debate on the release of terrorism offenders that the justice budget had fallen by 40%. When we contacted her, she said this referred to the government’s widely reported plans in the 2015 spending review, which would have given the Ministry of Justice a budget in 2019-20 that was 40% smaller, in real terms, than in 2010-11. The figure was still being used by the Guardian and the Law Gazette this month. However that 40% fall never happened. The Treasury gave the department £1.18bn more than planned for 2018/19, then £1.33bn more for 2019/20. In particular, the money was intended to meet a shortfall in probate income (generated from estates of the deceased), and to fund demand for legal aid that remained higher than the government anticipated.    The House of Commons Library also said: “There have also been significant operational challenges within the prison service, and additional funding has also been provided for court reform.” This means that the revised budget of the Ministry of Justice in 2019-20 is in fact about 25% lower in real terms (i.e. after adjusting for inflation) than it was in 2010-11. The government also plans to spend more on justice in the 2020-21 budget than in 2019-20.","This was a proposal, but is now out of date. The government announced a 40% real terms reduction in the Ministry of Justice budget between 2010/11 and 2019/20, but in the end the reduction was 25%.

","Following the unanimous decision of the UK Supreme Court that the government’s prorogation of parliament was unlawful, there has been some discussion of the judges who heard the case.

After we achieve Brexit, we must do some urgent reworking of our Constitution to put the people back in charge. This is wrong. The Lord Kerr who sits on the Supreme Court is a different Lord Kerr to the Lord Kerr who was an author of Article 50. The Supreme Court’s Lord Kerr is Brian Kerr, Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore, a former Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. The Lord Kerr who was involved with Article 50 is John Kerr, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, a career diplomat and former UK Permanent Representative to the EU. Between 2002 and 2003, before his peerage, he served as Secretary-General of the “Convention on the Future of Europe”, the body which drafted the text that ultimately formed the basis for the Lisbon Treaty, including Article 50. Information wrongly describing John Kerr as one of the Supreme Court justices was also added to Wikipedia, where it was live for just over an hour.","Wrong. There are two Lord Kerrs. John Kerr, who was one of the authors of Article 50, does not sit on the Supreme Court. That’s Brian Kerr.

Wera Hobhouse introduced the bill after discovering “upskirting” is not illegal because there is no specific crime covering the act.” Independent, 8 March 2018 Last week parliament was presented with a bill which if passed would make “upskirting” (or taking a photo or video up someone’s skirt) an offence in England and Wales. Upskirting is already an offence in certain situations. Offenders have been prosecuted for upskirting offences under the existing voyeurism clauses in the Sexual Offences Act, and the common law offence of outraging public decency. But there are criticisms that these laws don’t go  far enough.    For example, the offence of outraging public decency has to be witnessed by two or more other people. And to be an offence under the voyeurism clauses, the upskirting would have to record a “private act”.  The upskirting bill would add to the existing Sexual Offences Act, specifying that recording an image or ‘operating equipment’ beneath the clothing of another person without their consent, for the purposes of sexual gratification or to humiliate or distress the person, is an offence. The bill applies to the law in England and Wales as justice matters are devolved in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Northern Ireland’s voyeurism laws under the Sexual Offences Order 2008 are currently the same as in England and Wales.

","“I fundamentally disagree with the idea of a British Prime Minister imposing whatever her view is on the people of Northern Ireland when it comes to a devolved issue.” Kate Forbes MSP, 31 May 2018 “It's not devolved human rights, though. Human rights aren’t devolved.” Caroline Flint MP, 31 May 2018 Human rights aren’t one thing, they are set out and protected by different parts of the law and government. In general, human rights are a devolved matter for Northern Ireland, like anything that isn’t explicitly kept to Westminster. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 established a Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to “keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness in Northern Ireland of law and practice relating to the protection of human rights.” However, the Assembly and Northern Ireland Ministers must comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. They can choose to establish human rights requirements that go beyond the Convention, but they cannot choose to have less human rights. That rule comes from the peace agreement made to end the Troubles in Northern Ireland, known as the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement, which called for safeguards including: “the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and any Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland supplementing it, which neither the Assembly nor public bodies can infringe, together with a Human Rights Commission.” The law on abortion is also a devolved matter. It’s currently covered by the criminal law in Northern Ireland. How human rights relate to abortion legally is complicated. Many different abortion laws are possible within the European Convention on Human Rights, as the different laws in Northern Ireland, England and Wales and Scotland, and in Ireland show. Next week the UK Supreme Court will issue judgement on a case brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. It will decide whether abortion law in Northern Ireland is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights “in failing to provide an exception to the prohibition on the termination of pregnancy in Northern Ireland in cases of serious malformation of the unborn child/foetus or pregnancy as a result of rape or incest”.

Both the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Children Act 1989 define a child as someone under the age of 18. The UN Convention adds that this is “unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.” In the UK, children gain rights under certain laws before the age of 18. If you’re in England or Wales, you can vote in UK elections, and referendums, from the age of 18. You can register to vote at 16. You can leave home without parental consent at the age of 18. If a child leaves home, parents can apply for a court order to try and bring the child back. The court bases its decision on criteria including the age and wishes of the child, as well as any risks to their welfare in leaving home. In practice, it is unlikely that a court would approve a parental order to bring back a child aged 16 or over. Children can generally start to take up take up part-time work at 13 years old. In exceptional cases such as if you are acting or modelling you may start at a younger age. If that is the case then a special licence is needed. From the age of 16 you can start full-time work in Wales, having met the minimum school leaving age. In England you have to stay in some kind of education or training until you're 18 and we've looked at that in more detail below. At the age of 16 you may need to be paid through PAYE if you earn over £113, meaning you can be taxed. You also start paying national insurance from the age of 16 if you earn over £157 a week (as an employee). You can legally get married, or enter into a civil partnership at 16, although parental consent must be given in both cases if you are under the age of 18. From the age of 16, a person is considered to be able to give consent to all sexual activity with other people aged 16 or over. It is an offence for someone who is under or over the age of 16 to take part in sexual activity with someone else who is under the age of 16. You have to be 18 years-old to buy alcohol. But if you are over the age of 16 you can drink beer, wine or cider with a meal, for example in a restaurant, if you’re accompanied by someone over the age of 18. Children can also consume alcohol in private from the age of five.   You can also buy liqueur confectionery from the age of 16. You can get a provisional driving license and start taking lessons at 15 years and 9 months. The minimum age for actually being able to drive depends on the type of vehicle. For some very small vehicles, for example a moped, you can start driving once you’re 16. You can take your driving test for a car, and start driving, from the age of 17. That’s also the minimum age limit for driving a tractor or a motorbike too. If you want to drive a “medium-sized good vehicle” then you need to be 18 and you have to be 21 before you can drive vehicles larger than that. There are some exceptions to the minimum age limits though. For example, if you have applied for the advanced rate of the mobility component of Personal Independence Payment you can start driving a car at 16 years-old. You can join any of the Armed Forces without parental consent once you reach 18. You can apply to the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force at 15 years and 9 months and the Army at 15 years and 7 months.  You can’t actually serve in any of the forces until you reach 16 though. For all three forces you need consent to join from a parent or guardian if you’re under 18. A parent usually gets child benefit until the end of August after their child turns 16. They can continue to get the benefit until the child reaches the age of 20 if they are in full-time “non-advanced education” or “approved training”—this includes GCSEs, A-levels, BTECs, and traineeships. Or they can get it until the child turns 17 if the child has registered for things like further education or training with a careers service. Correction 2 February 2018  We corrected this article to clarify that you can work full-time from the age of 16 in Wales, but in England must stay in some kind of education or training until the age of 18.","Correct, although in some cases parental consent is still required for under-18s.

7,fullfact,"Both female Prime Ministers have been Conservatives.
","“...the Labour party has more women MPs than all other parties combined in this house, and a shadow cabinet of which half the members are women.” Jeremy Corbyn, 8 March 2017 Labour has 119 women MPs, which is more than every other party combined. The Conservatives have 67, the SNP 12, and there are ten more among smaller parties and independents. That adds up to 208 women sitting in the Commons, 32% of all MPs. A record number of women were elected in 2017. Labour also has a higher proportion of women MPs than the other large parties. 45% of Labour MPs are women, 21% of Conservative MPs, and 34% of SNP MPs. Half of the shadow cabinet members are women. There are 32 members and 16 women. In the government 26% of cabinet members are women, six of 23 posts. Not all members of the cabinet and shadow cabinet are MPs—a few are members of the House of Lords. If we look at the ‘Great Offices of State’ (the Prime Minister, Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary) the gender split is 50:50 for both cabinet and shadow cabinet. “When it comes to female Prime Ministers it’s 2-0 to the Conservatives.” Victoria Atkins MP, 8 March 2017 Besides Theresa May the UK has had only one other female Prime Minister. Margaret Thatcher served from 1979 to 1990 and was also a Conservative MP. This fact check is part of a roundup of Prime Minister's Questions. Read the roundup.","Correct.

8,fullfact,"There was a major increase in the number of “short” positions taken by UK hedge funds when Boris Johnson ran for Conservative leader.
","An article in the Byline Times, which has been shared tens of thousands of times on social media, makes a series of claims about donors to Vote Leave and Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign standing to profit from a no deal Brexit. But at least one key part of the article—a claim that the number of “short positions” taken by hedge funds increased dramatically in the lead up to Boris Johnson’s election as Conservative leader—seems likely to be based on a misunderstanding of the data. In reality, no such spike in the number of short positions seems to have occurred. A “short position” is effectively a bet that the price of a particular share will fall in the near future. For example an investor or fund will borrow a number of shares in a company from another investor, typically paying them some interest for the privilege. They then sell those shares on to a third party. If the share price then falls, they can then buy the same number of shares for the new lower price, return them to the original investor they borrowed them from, and will have made a profit on the difference.  A firm taking out such a short position has to register that with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) if the net value of the shares they are “shorting” exceeds 0.2% of the value of the company. Any shorting above 0.5% of the value of the company is made publicly available. A key premise of the Byline Times article is that the number of “short” positions taken out by UK firms dramatically increased after Boris Johnson announced his candidacy for the Conservative leadership, and reached a peak in the week that he was announced as the winner. We think they’ve made a mistake in this analysis: they only looked at the short positions that were still active at the time they gathered the data. By their nature, short positions may only last for a relatively brief period of time, after which the borrowed shares are returned. The data the FCA provides is split into two parts: “current”, which lists all the positions still active, and “historic”, which lists the positions where the transaction had ended or the number of shares being shorted has since changed. If you only look at the “current” data, then you’re obviously going to see a larger number of short positions in recent weeks compared to many months ago: the older positions will have ended or been altered since. We don’t know quite when Byline Times gathered the data they used, but using the most recent “current” data—going up to 8 September—produces a graph that looks very similar in shape to the one in their article: But if you include all the historical data as well, then you don’t see any such spike for the period covered by the Byline Times article: This apparent error has also been pointed out by several journalists on Twitter, including  Louis Goddard of Global Witness and Luke Bailey of the i. We asked Byline Times to share the data they used; they told us they would be publishing another article explaining their methodology, which they subsequently did. The article says they were “seeking to understand why” others could not replicate their findings. Byline Times suggested the reason may be because “Byline Times counted the number of position holders taking out positions, not the number of short positions” (despite the graphs in original article claiming they showed the “number of short positions”). They also said that they excluded all non-UK firms from their data. We don’t think that these factors are sufficient to explain the discrepancy; even just looking at a small number of UK firms and counting the number of position holders produces figures larger than some of the weeks shown in their graphs. We asked Byline Times to share the list of UK firms they were working from, and would suggest that doing so would help others assess their work. This is not the only potential issue with the article. The article also claims that the UK firms taking out those short positions were “almost entirely dominated” by firms that had either “directly, or through their directorships of other companies” donated to the Vote Leave campaign. We have asked Byline Times for more information on which firms they consider to have been direct or indirect Vote Leave donors; they told us they would not release this information for “legal reasons” because they had not contacted those firms. Their follow-up article does not detail the methodology they used to identify these firms as direct or indirect donors. The Financial Times has also raised a number of issues with the article, notably with the premise that a short position is necessarily a “bet on no deal” as the article suggests. For example, they point out that some companies would likely benefit from a no deal Brexit; shorting them would be effectively be betting against no deal.","We cannot identify any such increase; this seems to be an error caused by looking at incomplete data.

9,fullfact,"A survey found 11% of workers who report having taken a financial hit from the coronavirus pandemic have been evicted.
","“A third of workers have already taken a financial hit from the coronavirus pandemic, a poll showed tonight…Shockingly, 11% say they have been evicted from their homes – despite the temporary ban on rental evictions.”  Daily Mirror, 26 March 2020 Given the economic impact of Covid-19, concern has been raised that evictions during this period could leave people extremely vulnerable.  One statistic reported in the Daily Mirror was that 11% of UK workers who have taken a financial hit from the pandemic report having been evicted from their homes, despite a ban on evictions. While experts say that evictions have increased due to the coronavirus pandemic, this figure vastly overestimates the likely scale of the increase. The underlying data comes from a survey commissioned by campaign group Compassion in Politics. It commissioned research agency Opinium to survey a representative group of UK adults between 20-24 March who were working prior to the new coronavirus outbreak. Of those who said that their work was impacted by the new coronavirus, 11% said they had been evicted. This accounts for 4% of everyone who was in employment before the outbreak.  With 33 million people employed in the UK in January this year, this would equate to around 1.3 million workers being evicted (to say nothing of their families).  This number far exceeds the housing charity Shelter’s figure of 20,000 formal evictions (though this doesn’t include informal evictions which don’t involve any court proceedings), which is based on ongoing eviction cases in the courts which began before the government’s recent ban on evictions. Those are taking place due to all reasons, and not just coronavirus-related ones.  Grantley White Senior Research Executive at Opinium told us: “When it comes to the exact number of evictions taking place, this is a number that will be hard to understand for a number of methodological reasons. Nonetheless, we would expect that Shelter’s figures are very close to being an accurate representation because they will be using a methodology specifically designed to establish such detailed figures - our survey was aimed at capturing broader trends.” We asked Shelter about the number of recent evictions and a spokesperson told us: “Anecdotal evidence plus our experience researching housing and homelessness, and the private rented sector particularly, tell us that there almost certainly has been a spike in formal and informal evictions in the period just before the Government’s protections come into force. “However the level reported in this story and by the Opinium poll does not intuitively feel right.” Shelter added: “It seems clear to us that there has been some misunderstanding of this question by respondents and that perhaps fears of not being able to afford to pay for their housing, have in some cases got mixed up with actual eviction. “This is not to say that we are not extremely concerned about a probable rise in evictions as the implications of the virus on the UK have been becoming clear.”","Housing charity Shelter says there has been a spike in evictions, though not nearly as large a spike as this survey found.

10,fullfact,"Bus fares have gone up by 60% since 2010.
","“Bus fares have gone up by 60% since 2010.” Lisa Nandy MP, 11 February 2020 Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy claimed on Twitter that bus fares have gone up by 60% since 2010. This is correct based on one measure for buses and coaches, though there are other figures which show a smaller increase. This figure also doesn’t account for the change in wages over this period so it doesn’t really show how much more affordable or unaffordable buses have become.  Lisa Nandy’s office told us she was quoting the figure from a report by the Campaign for Better Transport. This data was originally published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and shows that between December 2009 and December 2019, the cost of bus and coach fares increased by 59% in cash terms, so not taking inflation into account.  But figures on the cost of bus fares (excluding coaches) are also published by the Department of Transport. These show fares increased by around 37% across Great Britain between 2010 and 2019. Although neither of these figures is very useful if you want to understand how much bus fare increases hit people’s pockets. For that you need to compare the increase in bus fares to the increase in wages over the same period.    Since 2010, average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain increased 24% in cash terms. This is slower than both the increase in just bus fares (37%), and bus and coach fares together (59%) over roughly the same period.   It’s also worth noting that, since 2010, the price of goods and services on average has increased by 22% (using the CPIH inflation measure).

11,fullfact,"15,000 passengers are arriving into the UK daily at the moment.
","Matt Hancock: “The number of people coming through has dropped very dramatically, as so there is very very low amounts—” Piers Morgan: “How many have come in this week?” Matt Hancock: “It’s about 15,000 a day at the moment from the data that [interrupted]” Good Morning Britain, 16 April 2020 The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, claimed in mid-April that airport passenger arrivals into the UK have fallen to as low as 15,000 a day amid the UK’s Covid-19 lockdown. We have been unable to find evidence to support this claim. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) failed to substantiate the claim made by Matt Hanock on ITV’s Good Morning Britain when we asked them. The Home Office has told Full Fact that it didn’t recognise the figure used by Mr Hancock and believed it was wrong, but wasn’t able to provide any alternative estimates when we asked for them. When we questioned several government departments about the figures, no one was able to provide an answer for where they came from. The DHSC did not respond to our questions. Data on how many people are arriving at the UK’s airports is hard to come by. We’ve no reason to dismiss the Health Secretary’s figure out of hand, but until the government can explain why Mr Hancock said what he did, we’ve no good reason to put any weight in the figure he gave either. We spoke to Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester Airports Group and none would provide specific data on daily passenger numbers, with some mentioning this could be commercially sensitive. It’s possible that Mr Hancock’s figure does use data provided directly by airports. Anecdotally, it was clear that passenger numbers had fallen to a small fraction of their usual levels. Heathrow Airport—which usually accounts for over a quarter of all passengers at UK airports—normally sees about 6.5 million passengers in March, but this year that had fallen by over half to three million. Heathrow has released a forecast saying it expects passenger demand in April to fall by 90% compared to the previous year—which would imply monthly passenger numbers in the region of 680,000, or between 20,000 and 25,000 a day (although some of these will be transfers and departures). This is just telling us about April as a whole, rather than recent days specifically.  There’s nothing concrete enough here to tell us very much about Mr Hancock’s claim, but it seems plausible that his figures resemble the scale of what’s happening. Most airports release passenger data on a monthly basis, so by the middle of next month we’ll have a clearer picture of the overall number of passengers at airports since the start of April. As for the reasons why, airports told us that passengers were not travelling for holidays, and said flights were still generally open for essential travel for key workers, repatriation flights and cargo. Heathrow Airport says: “All of our terminals remain open on a scaled down basis as we help with the repatriation of British citizens and the transport of vital air cargo. Vital medical equipment and supplies, including ventilators and medicines, as well as food are being flown via Heathrow, helping to combat the impacts of the global pandemic”. The real trouble will be learning how many people are arriving in the UK for each reason, as the usual means of doing this—the International Passenger Survey—has been suspended in light of the pandemic. In the absence of this data, there is still some information on the reasons for travel.  The volume of repatriations to the UK alone will have been significant in recent weeks. On 23 March, when the lockdown began, the government advised all British travellers to return to the UK. To get a sense of the scale of that undertaking, the average number of UK residents on overnight stays abroad on any given day was about 1.6 million (based on the latest data from January to March 2018).  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed to us that since the outbreak began, it estimates over 1.3 million people have returned to the UK via commercial routes. It said as well as helping to keep air traffic routes open, it has brought back over 13,200 people on 63 flights it has organised, and assisted 19,000 cruise ship passengers’ return. Cargo flights have also increased to fill some of the gaps left by falls in passenger demand. Heathrow alone says it has seen a 200% increase in cargo-only flights per week. The Office for National Statistics, which runs the International Passenger Survey, told us it was working on finding alternative sources of data for information on the reasons people are travelling, such as exit checks data gathered by the Home Office or administrative data from the Department for Work and Pensions.","The government hasn’t yet provided any evidence to back this up, and the Home Office has said it does not recognise the figure and that in their view it is wrong.

12,fullfact,"Average pay has finally surpassed its pre-crisis peak.
","“Average UK wages top pre-financial crisis levels.” The Guardian, 18 February 2020 “Wages back above pre-economic crisis levels.” BBC News, 18 February 2020 “Average pay has finally surpassed its pre-crisis peak.” The Times, 18 February 2020 The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has published data on earnings which was reported widely across the media. The figures show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in December 2019 exceeded the previous peak reached in August 2007. This data is adjusted for the change in prices (inflation) meaning it reflects a real increase in the purchasing power of workers. The ONS does this by converting the earnings from each period into 2015 money. So the figures reflect the value of earnings in 2015, not what they actually are worth now or when they were being paid out. In December 2019 weekly earnings averaged £473.68 in 2015 money, higher than the previous peak of £473.33 in August 2007.      But there’s one thing to bear in mind with saying that pay is now at a record high. The figures reported by the media represent what’s called “regular pay”. This doesn’t include bonuses, and so doesn’t actually reflect the total average amount that all employees across the economy are earning. (Not all employees earn bonuses, but some do.) When you include bonuses, and look at “total pay”, the average weekly wage of £502.74 is still below the February 2008 peak of £522.15 (in 2015 money).","True, for average weekly earnings in GB, if you don’t count bonuses.

13,fullfact,"Scotland has the highest taxes anywhere in Europe.
","“They (Scotland) have the highest taxes anywhere in Europe” Boris Johnson, 4 September 2019 (23:35) At his first Prime Minister’s Questions, Boris Johnson said that Scotland has the highest taxes anywhere in Europe. We asked the Prime Minister’s office what tax he is referring to but have not received a reply. (Channel 4 News also did not get an official response.) Over half of all tax revenue in Scotland is controlled by the UK government, but one of the main taxes set by the Scottish government is income tax. If Mr Johnson is talking about income tax, then this claim is incorrect. Many European countries have higher rates of income tax than Scotland. Additionally, Scotland’s income tax rates are very similar to the rest of the UK’s—and people earning below around £27,000 pay less income tax in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. If he’s referring to a different tax, then he should specify this, as otherwise it’s impossible for the public to guess what exactly he’s referring to. And regardless, we can see no feasible way his claim could be correct. In Scotland, you pay no income tax on earnings below £12,500 (the same as in the rest of the UK). You then pay: The rates in the rest of the UK are marginally different. Roughly speaking, people in Scotland pay less income tax than the rest of the UK on earnings below £27,000 a year, and more income tax on earnings above that. The differences are relatively marginal though. Someone earning £14,500 a year would pay around £20 a year less in income tax in Scotland, compared to the rest of the UK. Someone earning £28,000 a year (roughly average earnings in the UK) would pay around £10 a year more in income tax in Scotland. Someone earning £40,000 a year would pay around £130 a year more in income tax in Scotland. Someone earning £100,000 a year would pay just over £2,000 a year more in income tax in Scotland. This doesn’t factor in national insurance contributions, which are the same in Scotland as in the rest of the UK. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has compared income tax rates in the UK with a select number of European countries. They looked at data for 2016—the latest available figures for an international comparison—and found that a median full-time employee (earning around £28,000 a year) in the UK paid less income tax than in many other major European economies. A non-exhaustive list of countries where more tax was paid includes Denmark, Belgium, Finland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, and Spain. In 2016, people in Scotland paid exactly the same income tax as people in the rest of the UK. Today someone earning £28,000 in Scotland would pay slightly more income tax than in the rest of the UK. But these differences are not great, meaning the countries listed above have a higher income tax rate than Scotland. If you also include employee-funded social security contributions (the equivalent of paying national insurance), France and Austria also have a higher tax rate than Scotland or the rest of the UK, but Sweden and Spain don’t. The picture is roughly the same for much higher earners too. The IFS’s findings show that a top earner (£344,000 a year) in the UK in 2016 would pay less in income tax than in Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Germany, Spain, Austria and Finland. Once you factor in social security contributions, they would also pay less than in Belgium. Today, high earners in Scotland pay slightly more income tax than in the rest of the UK, but Scotland’s rate would still be lower than in most (if not all) of the countries mentioned above. We’ve asked the Prime Minister’s office whether he was referring to income taxes, or something else. But if he was referring to something else, not specifying what tax he was talking about is, at best, misleading. The Institute for Government calculates that 43% of tax revenue in Scotland is controlled by the devolved government in Scotland (with the rest controlled by the UK government). In addition to income tax, that includes things like duty land tax and landfill tax. We’ve not seen any evidence that Scotland has the highest taxes in Europe for any of these things, and it would be hard to make a fair comparison anyway, as each country has its own method of taxing things like land and council duties. Aside from income tax, one other major tax which is applied in a fairly uniform way across Europe is VAT. The standard VAT rate in the whole of the UK (including Scotland) is 20%. This is on the lower end of the spectrum among EU countries (where it varies from 17% to 27%).","Incorrect, a number of European countries have higher income tax rates than Scotland.

15,fullfact,"Under the Conservatives, the state pension has risen by over £1,450.
","“What we have seen under Conservatives in government is the basic state pension rise by over £1,450 per year”. Theresa May, 3 April 2019 At Prime Minister’s Questions last week Theresa May said that under recent Conservative-led governments the basic state pension has increased by over £1,450 per year. That’s correct when looking just at the cash-value increase. In 2010/11, the basic state pension for an individual was around £5,080 per year. It is currently around £6,550—an increase of about £1,470 in cash terms. But this figure doesn’t account for the fact that prices have also risen over the last eight years, meaning with the same sum of money today, you can’t buy as much as you could eight years ago—an effect known as inflation. Factoring that in, since the Conservatives have been in government the basic state pension has increased by around £550 in today’s money. Change to the state pension isn’t the only thing that’s impacted pensioner incomes over this time. Changes to the level of things like benefits and private income have also had an effect. Between 2010/11 and 2017/18 the income of the average “pensioner unit” increased by £936 in real terms per year before taxes. That’s an increase of around 3%. (A pensioner unit is either a single pensioner or a couple of whom at least one is above pension age.) Of that £936, £416 was down to increases in state benefits (including but not limited to the state pension) while the rest was due to other incomes including private or occupational pensions. So since 2010/11, the average pensioner unit has seen an increase in their income of around 2% before taxes as a result of government changes to benefits.  ","In cash terms yes, the state pension has increased by £1,470 since 2010/11. But after accounting for inflation the increase is around £550.

16,fullfact,"National Insurance Contributions are being used to reduce the national debt.
","“Our NI payments being used to reduce the national debt, no wonder the UK pensions are so small” Facebook user, 18 January 2019 A viral post on social media claims UK adults’ National Insurance Contributions (NICs) are being used to pay off the national debt. This is, in part, correct, but it doesn’t affect the amount of pensions or benefits people get in return for their NICs. The source of the viral claims is a response from the Treasury to a freedom of information request earlier this year. In it the government confirms that some of the surplus money it gets in NICs is invested in order to help reduce the national debt. There’s a clear hint in the viral posts that spending some NICs on paying down the debt is an inappropriate use of the money, because it means the money isn’t being used on people’s pensions or benefits. Some of the NICs surplus could, in theory, be put towards increasing pensions or benefits payments. But it’s also important to be clear that no one is getting less than what they’re currently due in pensions or benefits as a result of this—the money that’s going towards the national debt is what’s left over in NIC payments after this year’s benefits and pensions have been paid. There’s also no question of future pensions being unavailable as a result of this. This is a long-running debate (the current law allowing this dates back to 1992). Arguments have been made for many years that the surplus would be better spent on increasing people’s pensions, while Conservative, Coalition and Labour governments have argued that it’s more prudent to keep the money in reserve and invest it in the meantime to help pay down the debt. The UK’s national debt is currently £1,800 billion and every year the UK pays about £40 billion in interest on that debt. NICs are paid by employees, employers and the self-employed in the UK and pay for contributory benefits, mainly the state pension. So for the most part, today’s workers are paying the pensions of today’s pensioners. Unlike most taxes in the UK, NICs are paid into a specific pot called the National Insurance Fund, rather than being put with the rest of the tax money collected for the Treasury. Huge sums of money flow into and out of this fund every year. In 2017/18, about £100 billion went in via NIC contributions and about £100 billion left the fund again to pay for benefits. But the fund doesn’t always end up in balance. In some years, it needs to pay out a little more in benefits than it gets in contributions—a deficit. In other years, it pays out less than it receives—meaning it’s in surplus. When the fund is in surplus, that money is usually kept in the fund effectively as a reserve, to make sure there is enough money to pay for things like benefits and pensions in years when there’s a deficit. But the government doesn’t just leave that reserve pot alone. It invests it in the UK’s national debt, effectively reducing the debt. In its response to a freedom of information request earlier this year the government said: “The latest National Insurance Fund Accounts show that the balance of the NIF increased by [£2 billion] in 2017/18…. This resulted in a closing balance of [£24 billion], which was paid into the [National Insurance Fund] Investment Account and, in practice, used to reduce the national debt”. The House of Commons Library says in its briefing on National Insurance, “Since 2007 the Fund has been invested in the Government’s ‘Call Notice Deposit Account’, administered by the Debt Management Office… It is worth emphasizing that these funds are being held in this account on loan… there is no question of the Government being in a position to use this facility to extract money from the Fund as an extra source of revenue.” Even though there’s a specific pot of money for NI funds to flow into and out of, it’s not helpful—as the Insitute for Fiscal Studies has argued in the past— to think of this as a ring-fenced sum that’s separate from the rest of the government’s money. That’s because when the fund runs low (after, say, years of deficits in a row), the Treasury steps in and injects new money into the fund. And as mentioned above, the surpluses in the fund are also invested in the national debt. That means, in practice, some money flows into the fund that doesn’t come from NI contributions and some money flows out that doesn’t go to pensions or contributory benefits. In other words, whatever the amount of NI contributions the government raises in a given year, it always finds a way to pay the pensions and benefits it has to. The government can’t know exactly how much NIC income it will get in any one year, nor how much in pensions and benefits it will need to pay out. One of the roles of the Government’s Actuary is to help predict what will happen to the fund in future. According to a review in 2017, due largely to an ageing population and an increasing proportion of people claiming pensions, the fund isn’t sustainable in the long-term through NI contributions alone. That means it could need top-up money from the Treasury to keep pensions and benefits in payment, and that will come from general taxation. There may also need to be bigger changes—higher NI payments, lower pensions increases, and increases to the state pension age could all be factors.","Some are. This doesn’t mean anyone isn’t getting paid what they’re currently due in pensions or benefits—the UK government invests the NICs that don’t go towards paying pensions and benefits on reducing the national debt.

17,fullfact,"Universal Credit will mean 200,000 more people will be in work when it’s fully rolled-out.
","“When Universal Credit is rolled out fully, 200,000 more people will be in work”. Ross Thomson MP, 11 October 2018 This is what the government estimates will be the case by 2024/25. The suggestion is that 200,000 more people will be in work by that date than would have been the case if Universal Credit had never been introduced. But there are big doubts over this estimate: at the moment the government isn’t gathering enough evidence to know if this will ever be true. There are also uncertainties over whether the evidence that’s been gathered so far will be representative of future claims. Universal Credit is a new working-age benefit that is replacing a lot of existing social security benefits like income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance and Housing Benefit. It’s currently being rolled out in stages across different parts of the UK. The government started rolling it out in 2013, and it is expected to be fully in place across the country by 2023. In June this year, the government published its full business case into Universal Credit, examining what its expected costs and benefits would be. As the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions summarised in parliament: “when fully rolled out, Universal Credit is forecast to incentivise 200,000 more people to take employment than would have under the previous system and deliver £8bn of benefits to the UK economy per year.” The government’s basis for thinking the new benefit will increase employment comes from three things: The government estimates the first of these—the increased financial incentives—will account for over half of that 200,000 gain. Universal Credit is designed to make work more attractive to some claimants by taking less benefit income away when people start to work a small number of hours each week, through what’s called the “work allowance”. This incentive doesn’t apply to all claimants, though. Both the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and the Resolution Foundation have said that some groups—such as the second earner in a couple with children, or single parents—will have less of an incentive to work. This is because of things like the level the work allowance is set at, and the rate at which Universal Credit is reduced once the work allowance has been exceeded. Some people also face other barriers to moving into work, such as a having a disability. The National Audit Office (NAO) evaluated the government’s business case shortly after it was published, and expressed “significant doubt” about the main benefits of the policy. The first of these was over the evidence the government has gathered so far on the employment impacts. Analysis from a sample of claimants in 2017 showed those on Universal Credit were four percentage points more likely to be in work within six months of their claim being made than those on Jobseeker’s Allowance (one of the benefits being replaced). That offers some support for the government’s claims, but the NAO is cautious about taking this too far: “It is not known whether the employment impact identified by early evaluation can be replicated across the programme.” It says the claimants in this study were people with relatively simple needs with a lot of resources devoted to them. At the moment Universal Credit claimants are predominantly single people without children, and the incentives to work are different for different groups of claimants. For example, the structure of the benefit reduces the work incentive for the second earner in a couple. So there’s reason to doubt that the evidence on Universal Credit’s effects so far will be representative of future claims. 200,000 is actually the third version of a figure that’s been around since 2011. Back then the government thought 300,000 more households would move into work. In 2014 this was revised down to 250,000, and has now been reduced to 200,000. That’s partly down to policy changes over the period which have made the benefit less generous, such as reductions to the work allowance. Another factor has simply been because employment as grown and unemployment has fallen considerably over that period, “meaning it is now harder to get people into work”, according to the NAO. The other key problem with the government’s claim is that there’s no way to prove whether it will turn out to be true or not, because the government doesn’t have the right processes in place to gather evidence. The NAO said: “The Department will never be able to measure whether Universal Credit actually leads to 200,000 more people in work, because it cannot isolate the effect of Universal Credit from other economic factors in increasing employment”. It concluded starkly: “This, the extended timescales and the cost of running Universal Credit compared to the benefits it replaces cause us to conclude that the project is not value for money now, and that its future value for money is unproven.”","That’s according to the government’s own estimate, but it’s subject to significant doubt. It’s also currently unprovable: the National Audit Office says “the Department will never be able to measure whether Universal Credit actually leads to 200,000 more people in work”.

18,fullfact,"Universal Credit is working because over 3.3 million more people are in work since 2010.
","“We know that [Universal Credit] is working and getting people into work because our employment figures that came out yesterday show over 3.3 million more people in work since 2010.” Esther McVey MP, 17 October 2018 ""What we've done is look at the whole benefit system, how do we get people into work, 1,000 people each and every day. Those people will be on less benefit by the sheer nature that they’re now in work."" Esther McVey MP, 12 October 2018 Ms McVey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, has repeatedly linked welfare policies introduced under the Conservative and coalition governments since 2010 to there being 3 million more people in work. This is a misleading link to draw. The total number of people aged sixteen or over and in employment increased by 3.3 million between February-April 2010 (just before the coalition government took office) and June-August 2018 in the UK. But the increase in the total population aged sixteen or over was similar: 3 million. In short, having record numbers of people in work doesn’t sound as impressive when you consider there are record numbers of people. There are separate figures which do show employment has increased significantly under the coalition and Conservative governments: the percentage of 16-64 year-olds in employment has risen from 70% to 76% since 2010. However, there is not enough evidence available to know how strong the link is between welfare policies and employment. Ms McVey’s claim that 1,000 people a day have gone into work since 2010 is based on the increase in the total number of people in work. There were just under 3.3 million more people aged sixteen or over in work in June-August 2018 in the UK, compared to February-April 2010 (just before the coalition government came into office). That works out at around 1,000 more people in work every day. But it cannot be said that all of that increase is down to government welfare changes. A first main reason is that the number of people in work tends to naturally rise over time, and this will account for some of the increase. From February-April 2010 to June-August 2018, the UK population aged sixteen and over increased by 3 million. That increase is only slightly lower (300,000 people fewer) than the increase in the number of people of that age who are in employment. That doesn’t mean all but 300,000 of the increase in employment figures is down to population change. It won’t be, because not all of the 3 million people added to the population will be employed. Nonetheless, a significant portion of the increase in employment will just be reflected by the population increase. Using different figures, there is evidence that this government has been successful at getting more people into work. The “employment rate” is a better way of assessing the government’s record on increasing employment. It tells us what percentage of the population is in work, rather than the total number. The employment rate among those aged 16-64 has increased under the coalition and Conservative governments, rising from 70% in February-April 2010 to 76% in June-August 2018. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has called the rising employment rate “remarkable”, in the context of wider economic performance in the decade since the financial crash. But despite this rise, there is a second key problem with claiming that changing employment figures are down to welfare changes: we don’t have clear evidence for it. Universal Credit is the benchmark welfare policy of the Conservative and coalition governments since 2010, and Ms McVey has sometimes used it to mean “welfare reforms” in making the 1,000 people a day claim. The government argues that Universal Credit increases employment by making work more financially attractive than under previous benefits, has conditions which encourage benefit claimants to search for work, and has a smoother administrative process for claimants moving into work. If Ms McVey does mean Universal Credit when she says welfare reforms, then it certainly can’t have driven all the change in employment levels since 2010, as it was only introduced in 2013, and is still not in place across the whole of the UK. The government also argues that this will get 200,000 more people will be in work by 2024/25 (compared to ten years earlier). However, the National Audit Office says that, because of limitations in the methodology behind the government’s calculations, “the Department will never be able to measure whether Universal Credit actually leads to 200,000 more people in work”. They have also expressed “significant doubt” about the main benefits of Universal Credit. You can read our fuller assessment of that claim here. The bottom line is that we can’t say with any precision what is driving changes in employment and unemployment rates.

19,fullfact,"Universal Credit will make work pay.
","“Universal Credit will make work pay and increase financial incentives for people to work more” Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson, 3 February 2016 “Everyone can now see that successive cuts to universal credit have destroyed many of the work incentives that were supposed to be the very reason for the scheme, hitting single parents particularly hard.” Owen Smith MP, Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, 3 February 2016 Overall, Universal Credit—the new single payment replacing a range of existing benefits—will strengthen work incentives for people claiming the benefit, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. But certain groups will see their work incentives weakened. As the Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary says, single parents on average will see their incentive to work weakened. That’s because while on average they’ll get less either for being in work or out of work under the new system, the in-work support falls by more. The IFS says that this disincentive has increased after the level at which Universal Credit starts to be withdrawn for people in work was reduced in the budget last July. The new payment, designed to “ensure that work always pays” is being rolled out over the current Parliament. The IFS says that despite cuts to work allowances, mentioned by Mr Smith, overall Universal Credit will strengthen the financial incentive to work. Your work allowance is the amount you can earn before Universal Credit starts to be reduced. This is particularly the case for people who the IFS says face the weakest incentives under the system being replaced. While under the previous system 2.1 million people keep less than 30% of what they earn when they move into work, due to the loss of benefits and the payment of taxes, only 700,000 will do under Universal Credit. More than half of working-age people will see no change in their incentive to work under the new system, it says. The IFS says the biggest effect of Universal Credit is to strengthen the incentive for couples with children to have one person in the couple in paid work, as opposed to neither of them being in work. But the incentive for both people in the couple to be in work will be weakened. Overall, under the new system, single parents will have less incentive to be in work as they’ll have less support for being in work. This disincentive has grown since work allowances were reduced in the budget last July, the IFS has said. Previously, there has been a clear incentive for lone parents to work 16 hours a week, and little incentive to work more or less than this, the IFS says. As a result, it says that many currently work exactly 16 hours a week and few work less than this. Under the new system, single parents will get more support than under the previous system if they work fewer than 16 hours a week. They’ll also see their payments decline more slowly if they work more than 16 hours a week. This means that some single parents will choose to reduce or increase their hours due to these changes. The IFS’ analysis excludes the impact of other reforms such as the tax-free childcare scheme and transitional arrangements which ensure that families transferring from the previous system to the new one do not see any reduction in payments. So it shows the long-run impact of the changes rather than the immediate effect on households’ finances.","Overall, Universal Credit will strengthen work incentives for people claiming the benefit, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. But certain groups, such as single parents, will see their work incentives weakened.

20,fullfact,"Poverty has skyrocketed.
","“Britain's shame as poverty skyrockets with children and pensioners worst hit” The Mirror, 7 February 2020 “About 14m struggling to make ends meet—a record high, says Joseph Rowntree Foundation” “The proportion of people with a job who live in poverty went up for the third consecutive year in 2018 to a record high” The Guardian, 7 February 2020 Several newspapers have reported on findings from a new report about poverty from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The Mirror said that there has been a substantial increase in poverty in the UK, and the Guardian and the Telegraph claimed poverty was at a record high. The Guardian also said that poverty rates for people in-work has risen for the last three years. None of these claims are correct. In fact the Joseph Rowntree Foundation concluded that “there has been little change in overall poverty levels for more than 15 years” (see page 5). In its report, poverty is defined as households with incomes below 60% of the median income for that financial year, after housing costs. The median is the income which would be in the middle if you lined everyone in the country’s incomes up from highest to lowest. This 60% threshold amounted to around £262 per week in 2017/18. This is just one of many ways to measure poverty. Based on this definition, it is estimated that 14 million people in the UK lived in poverty in 2017/18: approximately 22% of the population. Whilst this number is one of the highest in the last 20 years, it is the same as 2015/2016 and lower than 2016/17. The poverty rate, which accounts for the rising number of people in the UK, has stayed between 21% and 22% since 2002/03. However, the groups of people that make up those in poverty has changed. Poverty rates for pensioners have risen recently (see page 19 of the report). And working-age parents and children saw increasing poverty rates between 2012/13 and 2016/17 before slight falls in the most recent data. In contrast, working-age people without children have seen decreasing poverty rates. Overall, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report that 13% of people in work lived in poverty in 2017/18, which was a slight fall from the year before (see page 31 of the report). We spoke to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who agreed that this figure had not risen for the last three years, but also stated that “what is a record high is the proportion of families in poverty with a job”. Of all people living in poverty, 56% are in a working family compared to 39% of those in poverty 20 years ago.","This is incorrect. A report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said that overall poverty rates have remained at about 22% over the last 15 years. However, some groups have seen increased rates of poverty, including children and pensioners.

22,fullfact,"If we left the EU without an alternative trade deal in place then we’d still have a choice about whether to put tariffs on imports.
","“Would we need to apply tariffs on goods coming into this country if we were out of the [EU] customs union? No we would not – that would be a voluntary choice for us, there is no need for tariffs.” Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, 16 March 2017 It’s correct that the UK would be able to choose what tariffs it put on imports from other countries, after it left the EU customs union. The UK wouldn’t have a completely free hand to do this. It would have to apply the same rates to all other WTO members, except where it has a free trade agreement or is giving preferences to developing countries. It would also have to keep those tariffs within limits agreed in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). And we wouldn’t have a choice about what tariffs were put on our exports. Mr Rees-Mogg went some way to making the same point about exports when he added: “We would be in a very strong position to retaliate if vicious tariffs were imposed on us.” Whether or not we’d be in a “strong position” to respond is a more complicated and speculative question than we can confirm or deny in a factcheck. We can say that any tariffs would have to conform with limits agreed in the World Trade Organisation, and also that other countries wouldn’t be able to pick on the UK and impose specific tariffs on UK-made goods or services (or vice versa). The UK will still be a member of the WTO after it leaves the EU (there will be negotiations about the details of the UK’s membership status outside the EU, although there’s some debate about how difficult these will be). Members of the WTO have to put the same tariffs on every trading partner worldwide, unless they are part of a customs union or have some kind of free trade agreement. The EU customs union is one such agreement. That’s why there’s often disagreement about whether to think of the EU as essentially pro-free trade or protectionist. It removes tariff barriers between its members, negotiates Free Trade deals on behalf of all of them, and imposes a Common External Tariff on anyone it doesn't have a trade deal with. The EU also tries to eliminate other barriers to free trade among its members, like non-tariff barriers, and there’s a question about whether the UK will have the same influence over these things once it leaves the customs union. Non-tariff barriers include things like common safety standards and professional regulations. Businesses find it harder to sell goods and services in other countries if they aren’t the same. Correction 28 March 2017  The factcheck now refers to the debate about the UK’s WTO commitments outside of the EU, and puts more emphasis on how they will act as a constraint on what tariffs it could set. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","That’s correct. In general we’d have to apply the same tariffs to all our trading partners and keep them within limits agreed at the World Trade Organisation. It would be up to other countries, not us, to choose whether to charge tariffs on our exports.

23,fullfact,"In the UK, women earn less than men.
","“If you’re a woman, you will earn less than a man.” Theresa May, 13 July 2016 It’s true that you would expect a woman working in the UK to earn less than a man. In 2017, the median hourly wage for women working full time was about 9.1% less than the median hourly wage for men (excluding overtime). That’s £1.32 less per hour. Women also do more part time work than men. If you count part-time wages too, the gender pay gap rises to 18.4%, or £2.52 per hour. The Office for National Statistics says there isn't a single number that adequately deals with all the issues surrounding differences between women and men's pay, but they prefer to look at median hourly earnings. The gender pay gap is the difference between men’s and women’s earnings. It is normally calculated by subtracting median hourly earnings for women from median hourly earnings for men. The difference is the gender pay gap. This difference can also be expressed as a percentage of male earnings. Imagine you randomly picked 100 women who work in the UK and lined them up in order of who earns the most per hour, regardless of the hours they worked. Then imagine you randomly took 100 men and did the same, before standing the two rows face to face. If you walked halfway down the row, to the 50th woman and the 50th man, on average that woman would earn £2.52 less per hour than the man she was facing, or 18.4% less. If you only lined up people with full-time jobs, you would expect the median woman to earn 9.1% less than the median man, or about £1.32 less per hour. That’s the gender pay gap for median hourly wages. You would expect the 11th highest earning woman who worked full-time to earn 18.2% less than her male counterpart, about £5.68 less per hour. The 10th lowest earning woman would only earn 5.0% less, about 42p less per hour.  The differences are bigger if you look at weekly, monthly or annual earnings, since men tend to work more paid hours each week. They’re also larger if you included overtime pay, since men tend to do more hours paid overtime. Including overtime pay, the median hourly wage for a woman is 18.9% lower than the median wage hourly wage for a man, if you count full-time and part-time wages. That’s £2.61 less per hour. The pay gap actually works the other way around for part-time jobs—women get paid more than men. This is called the ‘negative gender pay gap’. The median hourly wage for women who work part-time is 5.1% higher than for men, so about 45p an hour more. But the median hourly wage for part-time jobs is 35% lower than the median hourly wage for full time jobs. That’s £4.82 less per hour—much larger than the negative pay gap. About 41% of women who work have part-time jobs, compared to just 13% of men. So the fact that more women do part time work widens the gap overall. The hourly gender pay gap for full-time workers dropped by 8.3 percentage points from 1997 to 2017, with the pay gap for all workers falling by about 9.1 percentage points. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests one reason for the decline is that the overall level of women‘s educational qualifications has increased more quickly than men’s. In the late 2000s women became the more qualified group. If we take education into account, we can see that the pay gap hasn’t fallen for everyone. Although it has fallen amongst workers with GCSEs as their highest qualification, the gender pay gap has stayed roughly the same for people with A levels and graduates. So the gap has declined overall for two reasons. First, because of the declining gap among workers with only GCSEs. Secondly, because more women have moved into the higher educated, and higher paid, groups. The negative gender pay gap for part-time workers increased by about 5.7 percentage points over the last 20 years. For full-time employees in their 20s and 30s the pay gap is relatively small. It increases by a large amount for full-time employees in their 40s and 50s, and declines slightly afterwards. The negative pay gap for part-time workers only occurs for those under the age of 50. Among older part-time workers, men generally get paid more than women. How do we explain this? Part of the difference is between generations. The pay gap has fallen for people born in later decades. But the gap also changes over a single generation’s lifetime. After the age of 30, the average hourly wage for men continues to rise whilst average hourly wages for women stay the same. The IFS suggest that this is mainly due to the knock-on effects of women reducing their hours or taking time out of work to have children. It identifies a gradual but continuous rise in the gender wage gap in the twelve years after families have their first child. The effect isn’t the same for all women. Highly educated women appear to miss out the most from taking time out of work. The lowest educated women lose out very little on pay increases by reducing their hours or taking time out of work. The IFS suggests that the increase in the size of the pay gap is because women lose out on accumulating workplace skills and experience. But, as the report says, it’s much easier to spot differences in career patterns than it is to prove they’re the cause of the widening gap. And their account doesn’t explain the part of the gap that exists before the birth of the first child. The IFS agreed that their preferred explanation doesn’t rule out alternatives—as long as those alternative explanations account for the data properly. What would that mean? They told us that any good explanation would need to account for the slow, cumulative increase in the gap after the birth of the first child. And it would need to explain why a gap exists before people have children. For full-time employees, the pay gap exists across all the main types of job. Correction 16 November 2017  In an older version of this article we said that the IFS briefing showed the gender pay gap had risen for graduates over time. We clarified this with the IFS who told us it has likely stayed at about the same level, but it’s difficult to say for sure.","This is true overall. The gender pay gap is 9.1% per hour for full time employees in the UK, or £1.32 per hour. It isn’t true just for part-time work or every individual age group, and the size of the gap varies across different types of job.

24,fullfact,"The gender pay gap is at the lowest on record.
","“We have the highest female employment rate on record, we have the highest percentage of women on FTSE 100 boards on record, the gender pay gap is at the lowest on record... there’s still much more to do...” Amanda Milling MP, 8 March 2017 It’s true that we have the highest female employment rate on record. A higher proportion of women aged 16-64 are in paid work than ever before and the same is true if you count everyone up to state pension age. There’s still a nine percentage point gap between the employment rate for men and women aged 16-64. We also have very near to the highest ever percentage of women on FTSE 100 boards, according to the professional forum Boards Watch. The FTSE 100 includes the hundred most highly-valued companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. About 27% of directors on their boards are women: 32% of non-executive directors and 10% of executive directors. The proportion seems to have fallen fractionally in the months leading up to March 2017, although that’s nothing compared to the large year-on-year increases that came previously. Finally, it’s true that the gender pay gap is the lowest on record by median hourly earnings. That’s correct whether you compare hourly earnings across all workers, or just look at full time workers. There’s still a gap. If you knew nothing about two people except that one was a man, one was a woman, and both were working full-time, then you’d expect the woman to earn about £1.34 per hour less than the man. Your expectations would change if you knew a bit more about them. The gender pay gap varies according to things like age, how much you get paid, the hours you work and the type of job you do.

25,fullfact,"New gender pay gap figures reveal 8 out of 10 firms pay men more.
","“Gender pay gap figures reveal eight in 10 UK firms pay men more” The Guardian, 4 April 2018 New rules means that all UK employers with over 250 staff have to report their gender pay gap to the government. Over 10,000 employers had responded at the time of writing, of which around 5% either had under 250 employees, or didn’t provide the total number. 78% of these employers had a gender pay gap in March or April 2017. That’s around eight in ten. Among these firms, the median hourly wage for women is 10% less than for men. That compares to around 18% across all UK workers. These figures refer to full and part-time workers. It’s the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings, and is often expressed as a percentage of male earnings. That’s not the same as unequal pay—when men and women get paid different amounts for doing the same work. That’s been unlawful since 1970. 14% of employers with more than 250 employees reported no gender pay gap, and 8% have a negative gap (meaning women have a higher median hourly salary than men). Men had higher median bonuses at 53% of organisations, with women having the higher average at 15%. Across all employers of 250 people or more, the median bonus for a woman was 6% lower than for a man. The data also allows you to look at the specific situation at each of the 10,000 organisations in more detail. You can search for any organisation covered by the data here. On average, the bigger the employer-size, the higher the gender pay gap.The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that “over time the data will allow the monitoring of trends in gender pay gaps in different industries”. But it adds that the figures must be interpreted with care. It suggests that there may be different reasons for pay gaps in different organisations and at different points in employees’ careers. For example, it says “research also shows that some, but not all, of the gender wage gap is explained by the fact that after having children women are much more likely than men to work part-time, and part-time work is associated with little or no subsequent progression in hourly wages.” It also suggests there may be some errors in the figures organisations have submitted. For example, the number of employers reporting their pay gap to be exactly zero (in mean and median terms) is larger than would be expected. All employers with over 250 employees have to report their gender pay gap. This is based on a “snapshot date” in March or April 2017. Both full and part-time workers are included, and each is counted as one individual employee. Agency workers are counted as the employees of their agency or service company. Self-employed people are counted in an organisation’s data if they “personally perform” work for them. Employees based overseas are generally included if their contract is subject to English, Scottish, or Welsh law. Correction 2 May 2018  We amended the claim to specify that they were ""gender pay gap"" figures, and amended the conclusion to further explain what the gender pay gap is.","New rules mean all UK employers with 250+ employees have to report their gender pay gap. 10,000 employers responded, and 78% pay men more than women on average, based on median hourly earnings.

26,fullfact,"The gender pay gap is at its lowest level.
","“The gender pay gap is at its lowest level.” Claire Perry, 8 February 2018 This is broadly correct, comparing the median hourly earnings of women and men in the UK, excluding overtime pay. The gap has been falling almost consistently over time, although there was a slight increase in the provisional data for 2017.  These figures don’t show differences in rates of pay for comparable jobs, as they are affected by factors such as the proportion of men and women in different occupations. For example, a higher proportion of women work in occupations such as administration and caring, which tend to offer lower salaries. The Office for National Statistics says there isn't a single number that adequately deals with all the issues surrounding differences between women and men's pay, but they prefer to look at this measure of median hourly earnings. We looked at this issue in more depth last year. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Broadly correct.

27,fullfact,"At least a large part of growth in employment has been driven by an increase in insecure, precarious work.
","The employment rate in the UK is high by historic standards. At the beginning of 2017 a larger proportion of working-age people had a job of some description than had ever been recorded before. But not everyone’s convinced that’s the whole story and some of our readers have questioned it in the past:  So how much of the rise in employment been driven by a rise in insecure, precarious work? From the statistics, it doesn’t seem like unwanted part-time work or unsatisfactory temporary work has been the major driver behind the growth in employment. It’s a question that’s hard to answer with statistics alone, partly because one person’s idea of a “good job” won’t suit another’s. Some people will value secure employment, others flexibility, and presumably most people will want a degree of both. How secure people feel will also depend on things like their relationship with their employer and their own disposition. So questions of job quality are hard to answer satisfactorily with numbers. The proportion of workers who simply can’t find permanent or full-time jobs did increase after the recession but it’s been falling for the past few years now. The proportion of people who have a job has risen in the past few years to a record high (it’s been driven partly by a rise in the proportion of working-age women with a job).  Some of those people have either part-time jobs or temporary work (or both). Not all of them are happy about it. About 3% of UK workers work part-time mainly because they can’t find a full-time job. That is around 12% of the 8.4million part-time workers. Between 1-2% of people in employment have a temporary job mainly because they can’t find a permanent one. Around 28% of the 1.6 million temporary workers in the UK.  If we count these people out of the employment figures it makes very little difference to the overall picture. The employment rate for those aged 16+ is still relatively high by historic standards. We’ve used the employment rate for everyone over the age of 16 in the graph below so that we’re using an age group which is consistent with the over- and underemployment statistics (which we’ll get to shortly). The 16+ employment rate is slightly lower than the 16-64 employment rate because it includes people above state pension age, an age group that’s less likely to be in work.  The Office for National Statistics also collects data on people who want to work more or fewer hours. That’s a wider group than just the people who are technically “underemployed” or “overemployed”. To count as “underemployed” you need to be seeking more hours, work no more than the maximum weekly working hours already, and be able to make the change within the next two weeks. About 11% of employed people say they’d like to work more hours. But 8% of people in employment meet the criteria and are classed as “underemployed”. You’re only classed as “overemployed” if you want to work fewer hours and know you’d be prepared to take a pay cut to do it. About 31% of people with a job would prefer to work fewer hours, but only 10% say they’d definitely take a pay cut to do it.  The proportion of workers who are happy with their hours seems to have been steadily rising over the past fifteen years.  Self-employment has become more common too. There’s a fear among some that the economy is headed increasingly away from secure jobs and towards short-term, casual work. The statistical evidence we’ve seen suggests that people are generally taking up self-employment happily. We can also say that industries that make up the ‘gig economy’ still employ a relatively small proportion of the workforce. If these developments in the jobs market are a worry, it seems to be more of a concern about the direction of travel, rather than about where things are right now for most workers. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies put it: “The labour market is changing in interesting ways, but not fundamentally (yet).” We can also say that the steady increase in self-employment started before the wide use of digital apps to contract piece work, a hallmark of ‘gig’ industries. The proportion of workers who are self-employed has been rising steadily for about 15 years. We’ve written an introduction to zero hours contracts too. About 2.8% of people with a job don’t have a guarantee that they’ll work a minimum number of hours. About a third of them want more hours and about a third of them consider themselves to be full-time in practice. Many people’s perspectives won’t match the image of the labour market that comes from looking at national averages, as the chief economist of the Bank of England discussed last June. But, at the very least, these aggregates give a wider context for debates about how the job market looks in specific industries or regions, as well as for specific genders, ethnicities, and social classes (however you define them). The Institute for Fiscal Studies has also looked at what's been driving employment growth.","That doesn’t seem to be the case for the UK jobs market overall. The picture for specific industries, regions and groups might be different and statistics will only ever give a limited insight into questions about job quality.

28,fullfact,"Unemployment under Labour rose.

","“Under Labour unemployment rose.” Suella Fernandes MP, 6 April 2017 The number of people unemployed in the UK and the unemployment rate were both higher when Labour left office in 2010 than when it came to power in 1997. That summary hides a varying trend during that time: unemployment was relatively low for most of Labour’s stint, but rose considerably during the recession in the late noughties. When Labour won the 1997 election the unemployment rate for adults was 7.2%. When it left government in 2010, it was 7.9%.  The number of people who were unemployed rose from 2 million to 2.5 million.  Unemployment rates generally fell from the time of Labour taking power in 1997, rising after 2005. During the Labour government unemployment remained at around 5% for most of the 13-year period—in the ballpark of full employment, in practice.  The total number of people unemployed followed roughly the same pattern.  And Labour's time in government ended in a recession, which led to increased unemployment from 2008 onwards.  The main measure of unemployment in the UK is provided by the Labour Force Survey. This looks at “people without a job who have been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks.” It then shows this number as a share of the economically active population.

","“The employment figures show the strength of the fundamentals of our economy, with the employment rate never been higher, the unemployment rate the lowest than it has been for more than a decade”  Theresa May, 16 November 2016 It’s correct that the employment rate has never been higher on record (since 1970). 75% of people aged 16-64 are doing paid work, government sponsored training, or unpaid work for a family business (including people who are temporarily away from their job). It’s also at record levels counting people up to state pension age. And it’s correct that the unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been for over ten years. That means fewer people have been looking for a job in the past month, or are waiting to start one in the next two weeks, than at any point since 2005. But it can’t possibly be correct that: “...in the past year, employment in [Wendy Morton’s] constituency of Aldridge-Brownhills has gone up by 88,000.” Theresa May, 16 November 2016 There are only about 78,000 people living in the Aldridge-Brownhills constituency, according to latest estimates. Around 39,000 people were employed from July 2015 to June 2016. That’s about 4,500 more than the previous year. It’s not clear whether this is statistically significant. We’re not sure where Mrs May found her claim for the size of the increase. The ONS told us this is the most recent published data for employment by constituency.

30,fullfact,"A woman in her twenties will earn 95p for every pound that young men of their age earn.
","“If you’re a woman in your twenties you will earn 95p for every pound that young men of your age earn.” Jo Swinson, BBC Today Programme, 4 January 2017 That’s a justifiable thing to say if you look at millennials. Jo Swinson based her claim on analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank. It looked at survey data from the Office for National Statistics and found that middle-earning women born between 1981 and 2000 earned around 5% per hour less than their male counterparts, a smaller gap than in previous generations. In other words, if you knew absolutely nothing else about two workers in the UK, aside from the fact that one was a woman, one was a man, and both were in their twenties, on average you would expect the woman to earn roughly 5% less per hour than the man. The claim also happens to be justified if you look at the middle-earning woman each week aged 22-29. She earned around 6% less each week than the middle-earning man last year. Although there is a gap between the pay of men and women, it’s harder to say what the statistic tells us. As the Resolution Foundation pointed out, its measure of the ‘gender pay gap’ isn’t comparing like-with-like. It’s comparing median average earnings in the whole group of women who work, against the whole group of men who work. That’s a bit different from what people often think of as the ‘gender pay gap’: the idea that a woman will be paid less than a man for doing exactly the same job. For one reason or another, men and women in the UK tend towards different kinds of jobs, tend to work different hours, and arguably develop different skills and experience. So there are a range of additional reasons why the gender pay gap might exist, alongside the possibility of outright discrimination. Although gendered wage inequalities suggest a lot about the way we organise and value different kinds of work across society as a whole, and particularly how these kinds of social pressures and choices are gendered, they aren’t a direct measure of discrimination in the workplace. And there’s more than one reasonable way to measure them. The ONS suggests looking at full-time workers alone is a good headline measure. But the Resolution Foundation told us that it chose to include part-time workers this time, since it thinks the gap in hourly pay between full-time and part-time work is an important issue. As the ONS has put it: “…there is no single measure that fully deals with the complex issue of the differences between men’s and women’s pay” Different measures of the gender pay gap will capture different aspects of how the UK labour market is shaped by gender. “…women are going ahead of men before they have children and when they are concentrating on their careers, but what clearly is not happening is women are not maintaining their position ahead of men once they make different decisions about the priority of family life.” Jill Kirby, BBC Today Program, 4 January 2017 On the one hand, there’s evidence that the gender pay gap increases later in life, partly as women become mothers. A recent report by the IFS think tank chose a third measure of the gap to both the Resolution Foundation and the ONS, which helped illustrate a different point: it showed that although a gap in mean average pay for men and women exists before people become parents, the gap increases steadily and substantially for 12 years after the birth of their first child. The IFS’ main interpretation is that mothers who choose to take time out of work miss out on workplace skills and experience, and so lose the opportunity for career progression. As with other statistics on gendered pay inequalities, there’s room for a range of interpretations. On the other hand, we haven’t seen clear evidence yet that the same women are getting ahead of men in terms of pay before they have children. The IFS found that over a third of the eventual difference in average wages between mothers and fathers existed before the first child was born. Jill Kirby pointed us to a Guardian article from 2015, which was based on data collected by the Press Association. This suggested that women in their twenties were earning more than men. It’s not clear exactly how these figures were put together, or whether the analysis is still up-to-date, so we’ve asked the Press Association for the original release. Back in 2015, it was true that women aged 22-29 working full-time earned more each hour than their male counterparts. That was no longer the case in 2016.","That’s what you’d expect on average. If you knew nothing about two people apart from the fact that one was a woman, one was a man, and both were working and in their twenties, you’d expect the woman to earn about 5% less than the man.

31,fullfact,"We’re seeing fewer families in absolute poverty in the UK.
","“The last Labour Government took 800,000 children out of poverty…” Jeremy Corbyn, 30 November 2016 That’s correct by one reasonable measure. But there are many different measures of poverty. Mr Corbyn is talking about the number of children in relative poverty, which fell by about 800,000 between 1997/98 and 2009/10, not taking housing costs into account. It’s also reasonable to consider incomes when housing costs are included. By that measure, the number of children in relative poverty fell by less over the same period. It fell by about 300,000. Households in relative poverty have an income that’s less than 60% of the middle-earning household—in other words, they’re poor relative to other households in the UK.  This can sometimes lead to counter-intuitive conclusions. For example, it would be a bit odd to say that a family was lifted out of poverty simply because other families on the street got poorer. Another measure is absolute poverty, which the government defines as having an income less than 60% of the middle-earner in 2010/11. By that measure, the number of children in poverty fell even more under New Labour. About 2.7 million fewer children were living in absolute poverty by the end of the last Labour government, or 2.1 million fewer if you take housing costs into account. “...Under her government child poverty is rising and now covers 4 million children across the country.” Jeremy Corbyn, 30 November 2016 It’s also correct that the best estimate for the number of children in relative poverty has risen since 2010. It’s not risen by enough to say, with confidence, that we’re seeing a real change in poverty rather than a chance variation in the estimate. On the other hand, the estimate has risen consistently each year. It was down to 3.6 million in 2010. It now stands at 3.9 million. “We are seeing fewer families in absolute poverty and fewer families in relative poverty.” Theresa May, 30 November 2016 We’ve asked No. 10 which time period Mrs. May is referring to here. If you look at the trends  since the 2010 election, it’s wrong to say that the number of families living in relative poverty is falling.  The government’s best estimate for both the number of children and the number of individuals in relatively poor households increased between 2010/11 and 2014/15, whether you look at it before or after housing costs. On the other hand, it’s true that the DWP’s best estimate for the number of people living in absolute poverty has fallen slightly since 2010/11, having peaked in 2012/13. Again, that’s the case whether you take housing costs into account or not. The best estimate for the number of children in absolute poverty has remained broadly stable over the same time period. Again, none of these changes are large enough to say for certain that we’re seeing a real change in poverty rather than a chance variation in the estimate. It gets easier to spot trends in the figures if you look at longer time periods, so we’ve looked at the long term trends in our poverty guide. This fact check is part of a roundup of Prime Minister's Questions. Read the roundup.","It depends how you look at it and what time period you pick. If you take the claim to be referring to the period since 2010, that could still be correct or incorrect. The number of individuals in households that are in absolute poverty appears to have fallen, but the number of children has remained broadly the same.

32,fullfact,"23% of people in Wales live in poverty
"," “We have got 23% of people living in poverty here in Wales.” Leanne Wood AM, 23 March 2017 This is correct using the relative measure of poverty, and absolute poverty is similar, estimated at 22%. 23% of people in Wales lived in a household where the income is below 60% of the UK median between 2013/14 and 2015/16. That’s including housing costs, and is roughly 700,000 people. These levels have been roughly the same for the past decade, and slightly higher than other UK countries. The most recent figure for England is 22%, 20% for Northern Ireland and 19% for Scotland. An alternative measure is absolute poverty. This is where, instead of comparing people relative to the rest of the population, people are measured against a fixed standard of living. The government chooses to use the relative poverty line in 2010/11, adjusted for inflation. 22% of people in Wales lived in absolute poverty between 2013/14 and 2015/16. Again, that’s including housing costs and about 700,000 people. It’s still higher than 21% in England, 20% in Northern Ireland and 18% in Scotland. For both relative and absolute measures, the figures before housing costs are taken into account are a little bit lower. There are issues with using both absolute and relative measures of poverty to understand inequality in the UK. If you are interested, take a look at our piece here.   This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","This is correct using the relative measure of poverty after housing costs, and absolute poverty after housing costs is similar, estimated at 22%.

33,fullfact,"Child poverty increased by 250,000 in a single year under the Conservatives.
","“Number of children in poverty increased by 250,000 under Conservatives, figures show” Independent, 1 October 2016 “The number of kids living in poor households soared by 250,000 in a single year of Tory-led Government, damning new stats show.” Mirror, 30 September 2016 This is correct. The number of children living in low-income families increased from around 2.5 million to almost 2.75 million across the UK between 2013 and 2014 under the Coalition government, according to HM Revenue and Customs. This is an increase from just over 18% of all children (or at least, all children in families receiving Child Benefit) to 20%. But the number and proportion of children in poverty according to this measure has been broadly stable since the change of government in 2010. These children are in families receiving certain benefits such as Jobseeker’s Allowance or Child Tax Credit. They often have an income which is considerably below the average. Although the percentage of children in low-income families increased by 2% on the previous year, it’s a return to the levels found in 2010. Around 2.8 million children, or 21%, lived in low-income families in the year the Coalition government was elected, according to HMRC. Rather than being a figure for the whole year, this is just the number who were classed as being in low-income families on a single day in August. A family is said by HMRC to have a low income if they receive Jobseeker’s Allowance or Income Support, or if they get Child Tax Credit or Working Tax Credit and their income is 60% less than the median income. The median income is the income in the middle if you lined up every family’s income in the UK. The proportion of children in low-income families is calculated by dividing the number of children in families receiving these welfare payments by the number of children in families receiving Child Benefit. This is rather than using some other measure such as the census or birth records to calculate how many children there are in the UK. HMRC say that  using Child Benefit figures to count children is “the most comprehensive assessment of the number of children available at the local level.” The most recent estimate is that around 95% of all eligible children and young people have Child Benefit claimed on their behalf. But HMRC also points out that changes to the way Child Benefit was awarded in 2013 mean that “the measure may not be as complete as it has been previously due to families with higher incomes no longer claiming Child Benefit.” The trend isn’t consistent across all families measured to have a low income. The percentage of children defined as being in low-income families because the family receives Income Support or Jobseeker’s Allowance has been decreasing. In 2014 this was 1.87 million or 68% of all children in low-income families. In 2010 it had been 2.23 million or nearly 80%. In comparison the proportion of children in families receiving Child Tax Credit and/or Working Tax Credit, and who have an income below 60% of the median, has increased. Not all of the families listed as receiving Income Support or Jobseeker’s Allowance have a low income. HMRC says that it doesn’t have information about the incomes of the whole group, so the figure includes all families who receive these two welfare payments, not just those who earn less than 60% of the average. HMRC says the rise is down to an increase in the number of families earning 60% less than the median, not because families with children are getting poorer. The threshold below which a family is considered to have a low income went from £334 a week to £387 (for a couple with two children) between 2013 and 2014. For a single parent with two children it went from £262 to £304 over the same time. As ever, there are different ways of measuring child poverty. The data reported by the Independent and the Mirror looks at figures from HMRC. If you look at data on child poverty from the Department of Work and Pensions the figures are slightly different and are measured across the whole year, rather than on a single day. But since 2010 the level of child poverty has remained fairly stable whichever way you measure it. We’ve looked into poverty across age groups here.   Update 17 October 2016 We updated this piece to clarify that not all children and young people are eligible for Child Benefit.  ","This is correct by one measure. According to HMRC the number of children in poverty went from 18% to 20% between 2013 and 2014, an increase of 250,000 children. This is a return to 2010 levels.

34,fullfact,"Muslim women are three times as likely to be unemployed, and twice as likely not to be in the jobs market in the first place, compared to women generally.
","“Muslim women are the most economically disadvantaged group in British society, according to a report by MPs. They are three times more likely to be unemployed and looking for a job than women generally and more than twice as likely to be economically inactive, the Women and Equalities Committee said.” BBC News, 11 August 2016 These figures are all correct, according to official data. Muslim women are far more likely to be unemployed than women generally The report published today by MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee doesn’t actually say that Muslim women are three times more likely to be unemployed. But their inquiry was given figures by the Department for Work and Pensions, published separately, which show that the unemployment rate in that group was 16% in 2015. The unemployment rate refers to the proportion of those in work, plus those seeking and available to work, who are unemployed. Everyone else—people who aren’t seeking or available for work at all—are termed ‘economically inactive’. The unemployment rate for all women (aged 16 and up) in the same year was around 5%. Muslim men were less likely to be unemployed than Muslim women, but were still twice as likely to be out of work as men generally. In both cases, the unemployment rate has been falling over the last five years, but that’s also been the case among the population generally. It’s fallen by about one third among Muslim women and all women, so the gap hasn’t narrowed.  Higher unemployment for Muslim women can’t entirely be explained by things like English language skills, education levels or religious objections to working certain jobs, according to a study carried out at the University of Bristol in 2015. That found that Muslim women were 71% more likely than white Christian women to be unemployed, even comparing women with similar language abilities, education, marital status, number of children and strength of religious belief. The author, Dr Nabil Khattab,  suggests that this could be attributed to discrimination. That’s backed up by studies showing that CVs sent out under ethnic minority names are less likely to result in an interview offer, even if the qualifications and experience listed are similar to other applications. Muslim women are also less likely to be seeking or available for work in the first place The BBC is correct that Muslim women are twice as likely to be out of the labour market—'economic inactivity' again—although this also isn’t a point made specifically in today’s report. 58% of all Muslim women were economically inactive in 2015, compared to 27% of all women. A major reason for this is to look after the home or family, in the case of Muslims, whereas only a small proportion of women nationally give this as a reason, according to analysis of the 2011 census by the think tank Demos.","This is correct.

35,fullfact,"In January 2020 a new EU law means anyone who has an offshore bank account will have to “come clean so we can see how much they are hiding”.
","“come January 2020 the EU are bringing in a law saying that anyone who has a Off shore account will have to come clean so we can see how much they are hiding and to see if it can be taxed. No longer being able to get away with tax avoidance & evasion is what Brexit is about” Terry Christian, 1 September 2019 A widely-shared tweet by the broadcaster Terry Christian claims that the EU is bringing in a law in 2020 which will mean anyone with an offshore account will have to “come clean” and potentially have their income taxed. Avoiding this, he claims, is “what Brexit is about”. The tweet has been shared over 10,000 times, and screenshots of it have also circulated on Facebook. It’s unclear exactly which law Mr Christian is referring to—there are a couple of laws he could mean. However, we can’t find any interpretation of this claim that would make it correct. We’ve found two sets of EU laws (relating to tax avoidance and money laundering) that we think he could be referring to, as at least some parts come into place in January 2020. However, neither of these forces the owners of offshore accounts to “come clean” as the tweet describes. One possibility is that he is referring to the EU’s new “anti tax avoidance directive”, the last part of which has to be applied in member states by 1 January 2020 (although it’s unclear if they will still take effect if we leave with no deal at the end of October). However, its purpose is not to reveal money hidden in offshore accounts. The directive has five key legal aspects relating to: Broadly, the new directive is intended to prevent corporate tax avoidance practices, and has been planned since 2015. It “aims to address situations where corporate groups take advantage of disparities between national tax systems” to reduce the amount of tax they have to pay. In practice, this aims to tackle large companies shifting profits from the EU country in which they were made to a country with a lower tax rate or “preferential” rules. This could be another EU country, or a non-EU country. So these policies are about tightening up “systemic issues” to do with tax law in EU countries, to make it harder for companies to practice what the EU calls “aggressive tax planning”. Three of the five provisions of the new tax avoidance directive are already in place, with EU countries (including the UK) having to adopt them by 31 December 2018. HMRC told us that the new EU rules on interest restriction and the general anti-abuse rule led to no changes in the UK, because the UK’s existing rules already met or exceeded the minimum standards set. There were some minor changes made to controlled foreign companies rules, but none were expected to have any significant impact on individuals or the economy. The two EU provisions not yet in place are on exit tax and hybrid mismatches. The UK must meet the EU’s new standards on these by the start of 2020. HMRC told us the exit tax rules would lead to two “minor” changes. It’s also possible Mr Christian was referring to another EU policy coming into force next January: the fifth anti-money laundering directive. This will require member states to put mechanisms in place to identify ownership information on bank and payment accounts and safe-deposits. The EU told us that this does not cover bank accounts held outside the EU.     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as false        because there is no such EU law coming into place.    ","Incorrect. There is no such EU law coming into place.

","Various posts on Facebook claim that the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Professor Tasuku Honjo has said that coronavirus is “not natural”. The claim was also shared on Twitter, including by Lord Sugar. We’ve also been asked to check this by lots of readers. This claim is false. Professor Honjo released a statement on 27 April saying: “In the wake of the pain, economic loss, and unprecedented global suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am greatly saddened that my name and that of Kyoto University have been used to spread false accusations and misinformation.” Reports of this misinformation appeared as early as 22 April. In interviews and public statements made in the days before, at no point did Professor Honjo suggest the new coronavirus was unnatural. The false posts also claim incorrectly that Professor Honjo worked in the “Wuhan laboratory in China” for four years. Professor Honjo is currently the Deputy Director-General and Distinguished Professor at the Kyoto University Institute for Advanced Study (KUIAS). His biography on the KUIAS website shows no evidence that he spent four years teaching in Wuhan or China. We’ve seen no credible evidence that Covid-19 was man-made.     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as false        because there is no evidence Professor Honjo said this and he has denied saying it.    ","Incorrect.

37,fullfact,"Captain Tom and his charity walk has raised 15.5 million with over 750,000 people donating.
","A number of Facebook posts, shared hundreds of times each, share images of a WhatsApp message that makes a number of claims about the well-publicised fundraiser Captain Tom Moore is doing for NHS Charities Together. It makes claims about the amount of money the “charity organisers” are taking, and alleges that Captain Tom’s family benefits from the money raised. This is incorrect. It is correct that JustGiving keeps a percentage of the money raised through donations which goes towards service fees and operating costs. The figure given in the message may have been roughly accurate when the posts were published, and is now probably an underestimate. JustGiving told us that over 97% of the money raised goes to charity. We’ve written more about that here. JustGiving also told us that the Maytrix Group, the company run by Captain Tom’s daughter and son-in-law, does not receive any money from the fundraiser.   “Captain Tom and his charity walk has raised 15.5 million with over 750,000 people donating” The amount raised has now far exceeded that. At the time of writing, over £31 million has been donated to Captain Tom’s fundraiser by over 1.3 million supporters, in aid of NHS Charities Together. Donations were at £15 million on 16 April. These figures don’t include Gift Aid that could be claimed back and which currently amounts to an additional £6 million. Gift Aid allows charities to boost the value of donations from taxpayers by 25%. It essentially means that cash donations are treated as having been tax free, allowing charities to claim back the tax from HMRC.   “for every donation the charity organisers take 1.98% off the fee plus 20p per each donation” It’s slightly unclear what is meant here by the “charity organisers”. As we’ve said before, JustGiving charges payment processing fees for card or Paypal payments, which is 1.9% of the donation plus 20p. JustGiving says this charge “accounts for the varying costs of processing different payment types”. Donations made in another currency have a processing fee of 2.9% of the donation plus 20p.  JustGiving also told us it keeps around 1% of the total donations to cover operating costs, though it was not able to give an exact figure for this as donations keep rising. The platform has donated £100,000 to the fundraiser.   “then if you request gift aid they take 5% of the gift aid before passing it on” As we’ve also said before, if a donor adds Gift Aid onto their donation, JustGiving deducts a 5% Gift Aid processing service fee. This is collected separately from the donations made. At the time of writing, almost £6 million in Gift Aid had been collected (meaning a 5% processing fee would come to almost £300,000).   “so in total the charity organisers have made £600,000, not bad eh.. from what I can gather the charity organisers on just giving I believe are called maytrix.. oh the people who own/set up matrix is only captain toms daughter and son in law” The £600,000 estimate for fees taken by JustGiving may have been in the right ballpark when the Facebook posts were published, but the real total is  now likely higher than this as the total raised has also increased. Captain Tom’s daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, did help her father set up the fundraiser. She is also, along with her husband, the director of a company called the Maytrix Group. Speaking on LBC Radio, Ms Ingram-Moore also said that her company was initially sponsoring Captain Tom £1 per length he walked. Maytrix receives no money from Captain Tom’s fundraiser. A spokesperson for JustGiving confirmed to us that none of the money goes to the Maytrix Group and that the money did not go to anyone other than NHS Charities Together and JustGiving via fees.     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as partly false        because while JustGiving does charge a service fee and the fundraiser was set up by Captain Tom’s daughter, her company receives no money from it.    ","The fundraiser was at around £15 million on 16 April. It is now at over £31 million. This doesn’t include Gift Aid.

38,fullfact,"The NHS has issued a letter saying that some children infected with coronavirus have been exhibiting symptoms similar to toxic shock syndrome.
","We’ve had a number of people ask us whether a letter circulating on social media warning of an apparent rise in cases of children presenting with symptoms including cardiac inflammation is genuinely from the NHS. Because the SARS-CoV 2 (the coronavirus that causes Covid-19) has been found in some of these children, the letter says “there is a growing concern that a SARS-CoV-2 related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK.”The letter is genuine, and was intended for medical professionals working in primary care. NHS North Central London CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group), whose logo is on the letter, confirmed that it was real. The Paediatric Intensive Care Society (PICS) also confirmed that NHS England had sent out an alert over the weekend of 25 April, saying the same thing.   In response to the reaction to the letter, medical experts have generally stated that these symptoms seem to be incredibly rare, and, as SARS-CoV-2 is new, we don’t yet know all the ways it can present.  On BBC Breakfast on Tuesday morning, GP Dr William Bird said the numbers were incredibly small, and that children were still generally exhibiting mild reactions to the coronavirus. In a statement, PICS reiterated this, adding that while many of these children had tested positive for Covid-19, some had not. The letter also says the cases in question had some overlapping features with atypical Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. The cause of Kawasaki disease is not entirely understood, but its effects include swelling of the blood vessels of the heart. Toxic shock syndrome is a severe bacterial infection. Both require hospitalisation.  It’s very rare for people under 15 to die from Covid-19—data from the Office for National Statistics shows two deaths of under-15s involving Covid-19 were registered up to 17 April 2020 in England and Wales. However, children should be taken to hospital if parents are worried about any symptom they may be displaying. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has produced a chart of symptoms parents should generally look out for in children, coronavirus-related or not.

39,fullfact,"One picture of a teenage boy has been used to cover the deaths of three teenagers in three different countries
","An image made up of screenshots of different news stories has been widely shared on Facebook, claiming that a photograph of one teenage boy has been used to illustrate news stories about three separate deceased teenagers. Some posts imply the use of the picture is a media conspiracy. Many of the pictures come with the caption: “1 boy with 3 different names died 3 different times in 3 different countries”.  The screenshots are real, but they take a small number of errors from a few websites out of context to suggest a conspiracy. Several of the news stories in the image use the photograph correctly. There is no evidence the photograph has been more widely used across the media to illustrate anything other than stories about the boy shown in it. The boy pictured is Conor Wilmot, an Irish teenager who died in May 2017. A report of his death in The Irish Times, which said Conor was believed to have accidentally killed himself as a result of an online game, is one of the pictures featured in the Facebook image. The Daily Mirror also reported on his death, and its story is pictured in the Facebook image too. An image of Conor also appears in a story on American news site Black America Web warning about online safety. This screenshot is also in the Facebook post.  Also included in the Facebook image is a screenshot of a news story, which had the picture of Conor on an article about the death of 13 year-old Covid-19 victim Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, the youngest UK victim of the pandemic. No pictures of Ismail have been released since his death at the start of April. The story is from a South African news website Independent Online (IOL). IOL’s editor Riana Howa told Full Fact that the website mistakenly used a picture of Conor on the story, which was sourced from a Facebook page purporting to raise funds for Ismail.  “We were alerted to the error by Conor Wilmot’s mother and immediately removed the picture from articles and social media posts and apologised to her,” she said.  “It was an error and in no way meant to cause distress to either families.” In a Google image search of Ismail’s name, one of the first pictures that appears is one of Conor from a website called WikiTrusted under the caption ‘Who is Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab’. This is the screenshot that appears in the bottom left of the Facebook picture. The final picture on the Facebook image claims that the picture of Conor is actually of Isaiah Gonzales. The caption next to it is written in Czech, and mentions suicide. It says the image is taken from News 4 San Antonio.  A search of Isaiah Gonzales on News 4 San Antonio shows that he is actually a 15-year-old American boy who died by suicide in July 2017. As with Conor Wilmot, the News 4 San Antonio report ties Isiah Gonzales’ death to an online game. A report on Czech news website Blesk about Isaiah Gonzales mistakenly includes a picture of Conor at the end of a slideshow of images of Isaiah and his family. This appears to be the website used in the Facebook image. So while it appears that the screenshots used in this Facebook image do or have existed, several are accurate reports, and others are errors that have been taken out of context to imply something nefarious is happening.      This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as false        because it is not true that the same picture shows three teenage boys who have died.

40,fullfact,"Romanian workers are being brought in to do seasonal British farm work, despite huge interest in these roles by British people.
","We’ve seen a number of questions from people on social media, and have been asked by Full Fact readers, about why flights have been chartered to bring migrant workers into the UK to pick fruit. This issue isn’t one that has a definitive answer, but we can help provide some context for it. Last month it was reported that farmers could face a crisis as travel restrictions meant seasonal farmworkers, who often come from Eastern Europe, could not make it to the UK to pick crops, leaving them to rot.  Following this, a recruitment drive was launched and job site Totaljobs reported at the start of April that there had been an 83% increase in applications for agricultural roles in the past month. Then in mid-April, it was confirmed that a number of flights would be privately chartered to bring in experienced farmworkers from Romania. This provoked some backlash from people who felt that British workers were being passed over for roles, while others have expressed frustration at roles seeming to be all filled. Some of the debate may stem from uncertainty around the types of roles available, and what farmers need. In an interview with the BBC, a spokesperson for G’s, a produce grower which chartered two of the six reported flights, said that the foreign workers flown in on 16 April were experienced farm workers who were needed to train and supervise new recruits. They will reportedly make up a third of their workforce from foreign applicants, leaving the majority of roles to be filled by UK applicants.  A G’s spokesperson was also quoted in the Daily Mail as saying that “if everybody was brand new it would be very hard. These workers from Romania know about food safety. They will provide the platform while we train up the Brits.” It’s also worth noting that the cost of chartering flights means that this is only an option for the UK’s larger producers, and not for smaller operations that may also be affected by worker shortages. A number of farms have also stated that, although they currently have enough workers, they will be hiring more in the coming months. Farmers have previously said that there are issues with workers looking for short term work when some would be needed for up to six months to work on longer projects and gain necessary training. The Country Land and Business association estimates that 80,000 agricultural workers will be needed by the industry this season. Others report a shortage closer to 90,000, although it is unclear where this figure comes from. The Guardian reported in mid-April that 450 Romanian workers were expected to be brought in to help by one charter airline. This would still leave the vast majority of roles needing to be filled.  The same article quotes Concordia, a Brighton-based charity that recruits volunteers, as saying that despite high interest in paid roles, of the 35,000 applicants, only 5,500 had taken up interview offers.  So, it seems that while there has been a marked interest from British people in the thousands of farm roles, some organisations involved say there have been some difficulties in matching people to suitable roles and contract lengths. The number of foreign workers flown in is a relatively small proportion of the total roles that need to be filled, and the firms say that these workers’ experience is necessary while less experienced British workers are trained up. We explore this fact check in further detail on our weekly podcast.Click to listen","Farmers and produce companies say although there has been high interest and some roles are filled, experienced farmworkers are still needed to train and supervise new recruits and volunteers.

41,fullfact,"If you think you’re having a heart attack, coughing repeatedly and vigorously could help you.
","A Facebook post has claimed that coughing “repeatedly and vigorously” can help someone survive a heart attack if they’re alone. This shouldn’t be attempted, because there’s no evidence that it works, and doing so could make the condition worse or delay actual treatment. If you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, you should dial 999 and follow the call handler’s advice. The British Heart Foundation advises that “the absolute priority when you think you or someone else is having a heart attack is to call 999”. Heart attack symptoms can include chest pain or discomfort (though not always), and pain spreading to the arms, but there are a combination of other signs. The Resuscitation Council (UK), a professional body which trains people in CPR and publishes guidelines on it, has expressed concern over rumours of ‘cough CPR’. It said: “CPR is the correct treatment for sudden cardiac arrest…The majority of people having a heart attack will not suffer a cardiac arrest, and by attempting ‘cough CPR’ they could make their condition worse”. Heart attacks and cardiac arrest are two different things, although a heart attack can result in cardiac arrest. A heart attack is when a coronary artery gets blocked, stopping blood (and oxygen) getting to the heart muscle. If someone is having a heart attack, they are usually conscious, should be kept calm and 999 should be called. Cardiac arrest is when a person’s heart stops pumping blood round their body and they stop breathing normally. The British Heart Foundation advises that people going into cardiac arrest will be unconscious, and need actual CPR (and 999 should be called). You can read the British Heart Foundation’s advice about how to do CPR here. The Resuscitation Council (UK) says the rumour is likely “very loosely” based on some academic case reports of people with cardiac arrest who were able to maintain a heartbeat by coughing. Vitally, this was achieved in hospitals “during tests or treatments on the heart in which the person was being monitored closely and supervised by doctors throughout.” It should not be attempted by the public.

43,fullfact,"The number of deaths in the UK from Covid-19 is just shy of the capacity of the Manchester arena.
","We’ve seen a number of posts on Facebook that suggest the number of people in the UK who have died from Covid-19 is 20,319 and that this is almost enough people to fill the Manchester Arena. This correctly reports the government’s official figures on the number of people who were hospitalised in the UK, tested positive for coronavirus and have now died.  The actual number of people who’ve died with the disease will be larger, as deaths outside of NHS services or among people who haven’t been tested are not included. There are separate figures which can shed some light on these, but they aren’t as up-to-date. The most up-to-date figure at the time of writing shows that as of 5pm on 25 April, of those hospitalised in the UK who tested positive for the disease, 20,732 have died. As of 5pm the day before, when these posts started circulating, the number stood at 20,319, which is what the viral posts claim. As the post claims, Manchester Arena’s maximum capacity is only slightly more than this, at 21,000, although the venue’s website says it “holds around 15,500 on a normal concert”. The image in the post does appear to be of Manchester Arena. It’s important to remember that these deaths are what the government calls Covid-19 associated deaths in hospitals, and we don’t know what exactly these people died of, just that they had tested positive for the disease when they died. The government says that “Deaths of people who have tested positively for COVID-19 could in some cases be due to a different cause.” The Office for National Statistics releases data weekly on the provisional number of deaths “involving the coronavirus” in England and Wales, which includes breaking down the figures by where they happened (such as hospitals, home, care home, etc). The post also correctly says that there were 51 days between the first death of a patient who tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK, and the total of 20,319 deaths.      This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

46,fullfact,"The government’s own research says that Boris Johnson’s Brexit proposals would lead to a 6.7% drop in GDP.
","“The Government's own research says that Boris Johnson's Brexit proposals would lead to a 6.7% drop in GDP and 6.4% drop in real wages - the kind of hit to the economy experienced in the financial crash.”  Chuka Umunna, 18 October 2019 Mr Umunna was referencing economic analyses published by the government in November 2018, which modelled the economic outcomes under different Brexit scenarios. But he’s wrong to say GDP and real wages would “drop” according to this analysis and his comparison to the financial crash is misleading. The government estimated that a hypothetical free-trade agreement (FTA) with the EU where we maintained tariff-free access but there were still non-tariff costs (such as regulatory barriers) would cost the UK between 4.9% and 6.7% GDP growth after 15 years.  GDP (or Gross Domestic Product) is the total value of everything that happens within a country’s economy—the goods and services made and the money earned. It’s the main way economists measure how well the economy is doing. The FTA scenario is the most likely scenario following the deal agreed by Boris Johnson’s government and the EU, though the details of the trade deal would not be agreed for a while yet, so this is all still hypothetical.  However, that aside, it’s incorrect to claim the analysis said that the proposals would lead to a 6.7% drop to GDP, as Mr Umunna said. The analysis said that GDP would be up to 6.7% lower after 15 years than it would have been compared to remaining in the EU. The document said “in all scenarios the economy would be expected to grow.” It’s worth mentioning that the 6.7% figure assumed that the net migration from the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) to the UK would fall to zero—in other words the number of EU immigrants coming to the UK would be balanced by the number emigrating abroad. Other estimates of the free-trade model with a more liberal migration policy were estimated to have a lower impact on GDP.   More recently think tank UK in a Changing Europe estimated GDP per person would be between 2.3% and 7% lower under Mr Johnson’s deal than remaining in the EU after 10 years.   Mr Umunna claimed that the scale of the impact on GDP would be comparable to the financial crash. This is an unfair comparison.  Between the first quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009, GDP fell by 6%. GDP per person fell even more, by 8.5% over that period.  But the key thing is that GDP is still expected to grow in real terms under the new withdrawal agreement. It’s unfair to compare the tangible loss in incomes and earnings over a period of 15 months during the financial crisis, with a similarly sized loss of potential earnings over a period of 15 years.   For wages, the comparison is even more problematic. Weekly wages fell, in real terms (adjusting for changes in prices) by 11.2% between the high in February 2008 and the low during March 2014. This covers wages for employees in Great Britain.  So not only is the comparison between a real cut to peoples’ wages during the financial crisis and a hypothetical loss of earnings due to Brexit, the level of financial loss is fairly different. The government estimates wages to be 6.4% lower over a fifteen year period. During the financial crisis and its aftermath, wages fell by 11.2% over six years. The new withdrawal agreement is seen to be a “harder” Brexit than that negotiated under Theresa May. As such, economists estimate the impact on the economy to be greater.  UK in a Changing Europe modelled the impact of Theresa May’s deal, Boris Johnson’s deal and a no deal “WTO” Brexit.  It estimated that, after ten years, GDP per person would be around £1,500 less under May’s deal, £2,000 less under Johnson’s deal and £2,500 less under no deal, compared to staying within the EU.  Its analysis took into account two things: the expected direct impact of Brexit on trade volumes and the cost of doing trade, and the knock-on impact that trade can have on productivity (which accounted for most of the costs). As mentioned before, these estimates don’t necessarily mean that people will be worse off by £2,500 in ten years than they are now. They estimate people will be less well off by that much than if we had remained in the EU. Economic forecasts over such long periods and where the details of what might happen in the future are unknown must be taken with a large pinch of salt.   As UK in a Changing Europe says: “As we have emphasised throughout, these estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, for two reasons. “First, there is inherent uncertainty associated with forecasting the impact of economic policy choices.  “Second, there is also political uncertainty as to what those future policy choices will be, both on the part of the UK and the EU.  “Nevertheless, it should be clear that under any plausible scenario the costs associated with Brexit’s potential economic effects are much larger than the savings from reduced contributions to the EU budget.”","The government estimated a free trade agreement Brexit could lead to GDP being 6.7% lower after 15 years than if the UK remained in the EU. That’s not the same as saying this form of Brexit will lead to a drop in GDP compared to now.

47,fullfact,"Tens of thousands of workers will share in a £1.8 billion pay rise under a US trade deal.
","“Tens of thousands of workers will share in a £1.8 billion pay rise under a US trade deal that is “there for the taking”, the International Trade Secretary says.” Daily Telegraph, 1 March 2020 Recently, the government published a document outlining its approach to trade negotiations with the USA. The document said that a trade deal with the US could increase UK workers’ wages by £1.8 billion after 15 years, which the Telegraph reported as saying it would benefit “tens of thousands of workers.” However, this shouldn’t be understood as suggesting that a US deal will increase wages relative to where they are now, but that they’re relative to the level expected should we sign a free trade agreement with the EU first. In 2018 the Treasury did some analysis and estimated that leaving the EU and negotiating a free-trade agreement would leave wages around 6.4% lower than they would have been had we stayed in the EU, after 15 years. (That does not necessarily mean that wages would be lower than today; they might still have grown, but by less.) The new analysis from the Department for International Trade (DIT) uses this as a starting point.  It says that, assuming the UK signs that sort of free-trade agreement with the EU, signing a free trade agreement with the US would then put wages back up by £1.8 billion or 0.2%, again after 15 years. So even if the UK signs free-trade agreements with both the EU and US, the government still expects wages to be around 6% lower after 15 years than the level they would have been expected to reach, had we stayed in the EU. Even then, there are some assumptions in the analysis that seem questionable. The £1.8 billion wage growth assumes a free-trade agreement between UK and US with zero tariffs (complete tariff liberalization) and a reduction of non-tariff measures (such as plant and animal health regulations) by 50%. This is called ‘scenario 2’ in the document. Professor of Economics at the City College of New York, Marta Bengoa, told us:  “Scenario 2 is extremely optimistic as the roadblocks to a [free trade agreement] with the US remain significant. The UK will have to choose between regulatory alignment with the European Union or the United States and that will be a key factor to determine the degree of trade liberalization between UK and US. “If UK chooses to continue/maintain regulatory coherence with the EU, then the scope of the UK-US agreement will be quite limited. “This is without factorizing the current protectionist approach of the current US administration.” In other words the analysis seems to be based on a questionable premise, in assuming that the UK can both have zero-tariff trade with the EU and with the US after signing trade deals. Professor Bengoa said scenario 1, with less extensive tariff liberalisation with the US, is “more realistic” with a positive wage effect of 0.1%. She added: “The model also assumes a fixed labor supply, no changes in demography, and no major technological changes or shocks. These assumptions are quite strict for a period of 15 years. She said the model the analysis based on is “widely used in trade policy analysis but many of the underlying assumptions are difficult to match with the reality of the always changing economic environment.” Finally, the Telegraph reported that the possible wage rise will be shared by “tens of thousands of workers.” This suggests the wage effects will be concentrated among a small group of workers, while the Department for International Trade didn’t actually model the effect on specific groups. That means, though you might expect a trade deal to benefit some people (such as those whose jobs are heavily involved in imports and exports) more than others, it’s not quite right to specify that a trade deal would benefit “tens of thousands of workers.” Spread across the whole workforce, a £1.8 billion increase amounts to around £55 per worker per year.","Government analysis shows wages could be 0.2% (£1.8 billion) higher after 15 years under a scenario where we sign a free trade deal with the USA compared to a baseline scenario where we don’t. But this baseline assumes wages will be 6.4% lower than they would have been, had we remained in the EU.

","“Once we come out of the single market freedom of movement falls.”Diane Abbott MP, 19 February 2020 “Norway’s not in the single market and yet they have free movement.”Kay Burley, 19 February 2020 Asked on Sky News if a future Labour government would reintroduce the free movement of people between the UK and the EU, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said: “Once we come out of the single market, freedom of movement falls.” Presenter Kay Burley responded by saying, “Norway’s not in the single market and yet they have free movement.” Ms Abbott was correct on her point. But Ms Burley was incorrect to say that Norway is not in the single market. It is their place in the single market that means they follow freedom of movement rules. What is the single market? The single market refers the trading area in the EU. EU states are members and have to follow all the market’s rules, principally the free movement of goods, people, services and capital. In addition, members of the European Economic Area (EEA) align their rules to the single market and so are essentially part of it. This includes Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020, but remains a member of the single market during the transition period. Is Norway in the single market? Norway is part of the single market, which is why it follows the four freedoms. Ms Burley was wrong to suggest otherwise. Later in the interview, Ms Burley seemed to correct herself by saying, “Norway are not in the European Union, as I’ve said, and they have free movement of people.” This statement is true. Norway is not in the EU. It is only in the single market. Brexit with free movement Ms Abbott is correct to say that once the UK leaves the single market, freedom of movement no longer applies. After Ms Burley corrects herself and suggests she has been referring to the EU, and not the single market, all along, Ms Abbott then changes her previously correct statement, saying “once we actually leave the EU, freedom of movement falls.” This is technically incorrect. The UK has already left the EU and still has freedom of movement. The UK could also keep free movement of people with the EU after the end of the transition period, as part of a future trade deal with the EU. However this is not and has never been the government’s plan. It would require the UK to negotiate with the EU to stay in the single market.","Norway does have free movement, but it is in the single market.

50,fullfact,"One estimate of the “economic cost” of Brexit, £130 billion, now exceeds what we’ve paid in to the EU over 47 years.
","Lots of Full Fact readers have asked us to check a number of posts on social media which have claimed that “the economic cost of Brexit now exceeds what we’ve net paid-in to the EU over 47 years”. While it’s difficult to put a single, definitive figure on the economic impact of Brexit, these claims don’t currently add up. They are based on figures which actually show the UK’s net contributions are higher than an estimated economic cost so far. Other reports have made a more defensible claim: that Brexit will “have soon cost” or “is set to cost” the UK more than 47 years of payments to the EU budget. But these still depend on accepting an uncertain estimate for the cost of Brexit so far, plus even more uncertain estimates of the future cost. And even then, the figure at the end of 2020 is still slightly lower. The claims are based on analysis by Bloomberg Economics which found that the “economic cost” of Brexit to the UK was £130 billion by the end of 2019. This looks at how much lower GDP is in real terms than it otherwise might have been had previous trends (from before the vote to leave the EU) continued between 2016 and 2019. This “cost”, according to the analysis, is set to rise to £200 billion by the end of 2020. To put that in context, the whole UK economy was worth about £2,144 billion—or £2.1 trillion—in 2018. Following the publication of the analysis these figures were then compared on social media (not by Bloomberg) to the UK’s total net contributions to the EU. Bloomberg Economics told us that the £200 billion figure it came up with was an estimate, as it’s impossible to be sure what the economy would have looked like if the UK had voted to remain in the EU in 2016. Many different estimates have been done of the impact of Brexit on the UK, as we’ve written about before. We haven’t looked in detail at Bloomberg Economics’ calculations, but it’s already clear that its estimates are still less than the UK’s net contributions to the EU. At the moment we only have figures on what the UK has contributed to the EU up to the end of 2018, so covering 45 years rather than 47. These have been gathered by the House of Commons Library. In that time the UK’s net contribution to the EU between 1973 and 2018 was about £216 billion in real terms (accounting for the way prices change over time and using 2019 prices). The net contribution was £156 billion in cash terms (not accounting for inflation). Both of these contribution figures are higher than the “economic cost of Brexit” estimated by Bloomberg Economics up to the end of 2019. The real terms figure of EU contributions (the more meaningful of the two) is still higher than the “cost of Brexit” estimated up to the end of 2020. If you estimate what the UK will have paid in net contributions by 2020, using the latest figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility on the financial settlement with the EU, then it comes to around £222 billion in real terms.","There’s no definitive figure for the economic impact of Brexit. The analysis this is based on estimates the UK’s GDP is £130 billion lower in 2019 than it would have been had it followed pre-EU referendum trends. Between 1973 and 2018 the UK’s net contribution to the EU was £216 billion in real terms.

51,fullfact,"A three month extension to Brexit will cost £1 billion a month.
","“They made it inevitable that the people of this country would be retained in the EU against their will for at least another three months, at a cost of another £1 billion a month.”  Boris Johnson, 28 October 2019 “It is a week since this parliament voted, yet again, to force Brussels to keep this country in the European Union for at least another three months, at a cost of £1 billion a month.” Boris Johnson, 29 October 2019 In the House of Commons this week, Boris Johnson has twice repeated his claim that extending the date of Brexit for three months would cost £1 billion a month. This is false, as we have said repeatedly. A three month extension costs the UK the same amount in EU budget payments as leaving under Boris Johnson’s own deal on 31 October would have. Mr Johnson should correct his untrue statements to the House. The claim is based on the amount that the UK pays into the EU budget. Those payments are worth roughly £1 billion a month, although this doesn’t take into account some money that the UK gets back from the EU, as BBC Reality Check has pointed out.  But under Boris Johnson’s proposed deal, the UK will pay these budget contributions even after we’ve left the EU, until the end of December 2020. This is part of the financial settlement (better known as the “divorce bill”). This is the same situation as under Theresa May’s deal—Boris Johnson’s government did not renegotiate the financial settlement. That means the budget payments made during a Brexit extension to January 2020 simply have the effect of reducing the total divorce bill upon the UK’s departure. This has already happened before: the divorce bill was estimated at around £39 billion in March 2019, but is now down to around £33 billion as a result of extending the Brexit date by six months. There is a separate decision that the government will need to make before 1 July 2020, about whether the UK wants to extend the transition period that follows Brexit beyond its current end date of December 2020. The dates of this transition period have not changed from Theresa May’s deal to Boris Johnson’s deal. If the government does decide to extend that period, and the EU agrees to the extension, that would mean that the UK would need to pay into the EU budget for a longer period. At this point the UK and EU would have to negotiate what level of budget contribution the UK would make during the extended transition. The Ministerial Code, which governs the behaviour of ministers—and which the Prime Minister himself is in charge of enforcing—says that it is “of paramount importance that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity.” The Prime Minister should uphold these principles and correct his untrue statements in the House of Commons.","No it won’t. The UK would still pay that amount if it left in October under Boris Johnson’s deal.

52,fullfact,"An extension to the date of Brexit would cost £1 billion a month.
","“I think that it would be a mistake to keep the UK bound in beyond the time that the people want to come out… at a cost of £1 billion a month.” Boris Johnson, BBC Radio 4 Today, 1 October 2019 (2 h 21 m) This morning, the Prime Minister repeated his inaccurate claim that extending the date of Brexit beyond 31 October would cost “£1 billion a month”.  This is not true. The Prime Minister says he wants to leave on 31 October with a deal. If he does, the UK will be in a transition period to the end of December 2020, during which it will pay into the EU budget anyway. So extending the date of Brexit into 2020 won’t, by itself, cost us any more in budget contributions than leaving with a deal in October this year would. Those payments just get taken off the final “divorce bill” when we leave. The government has given no indication that it plans to renegotiate either the financial settlement part of the deal—the divorce bill—or the transition period in the month remaining. That situation hasn’t changed since we first fact checked this a month ago. And if you’re not planning to renegotiate the divorce bill or the transition, then the only way you can claim extending would cost us £1 billion more is if you’re comparing it to leaving with no deal, and refusing to pay the divorce bill. The Prime Minister has said that, in the event of no deal, he does plan to not pay the financial settlement (the legal situation of that would be uncertain). But he also repeated in his Today interview that his plan is to leave with a deal. The EU has also made clear that it will make the divorce bill a condition of any future trade deal. You can see evidence that a short extension wouldn’t cost us more from the fact this has already happened once. Because the UK has stayed a full EU member longer than expected, we have paid budget contributions since 29 March. But all that means is that the divorce bill has gone down by the same amount: the original divorce bill was around £39 billion in March, but this has now gone down to £33 billion. It does not in itself make any difference to how much we pay. If the UK had a deal but extended the transition to 2021 or 2022 (which is possible under the current agreement if both sides agree, but is not something the Prime Minister has said he wants to do), then the UK would pay more, as it would continue contributing to the EU budget for those extra years. But we don’t know how much that would be, as the EU hasn’t yet set its budget for then. Mr Johnson’s government has publicly said it is committed to getting a deal with the EU, and hasn’t said it wants to renegotiate the divorce bill or the transition. That’s what makes this claim wrong. If the government publicly said its policy was to go for no deal, then it could argue that it would try to avoid paying the divorce bill. If they then succeeded in avoiding that bill, this claim might be in the right ballpark (although still not quite right, as BBC Reality Check have pointed out). But as it stands, the Prime Minister asserted two contradictory things in the same interview. You can say your plan is to leave with a deal, or you can say an extension will cost £1 billion a month, but you can't say both.","Wrong. An extension of a few months would cost no more than leaving with a deal in October 2019, which is still the government’s publicly stated policy.

Raab: Not a billion pounds each day, for sure, which is the price tag. Dominic Raab MP, Radio 5 Live Breakfast, 3 September 2019 This morning, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab claimed that the Bill from Hilary Benn MP and others, intended to rule out a no deal Brexit unless parliament consents, would cost British taxpayers £1 billion a month (we assume Mr Raab misspoke when he said £1 billion “a day” in his Radio 5 Live interview, as that would be very wrong). It’s also been reported that the same £1 billion a month claim was made by a Number 10 spokesperson, attributing it to the UK having to pay additional EU budget contributions if our exit from the EU is delayed. This is potentially misleading, as it’s based on comparing the cost of any extension specifically to a no deal scenario in which the UK did not pay any of the “divorce bill” (the financial settlement previously agreed with the EU). But the government’s stated intent, repeated by Mr. Raab in the same interviews, is still to leave with a deal. Most studies predict that the economic effects of leaving the EU will exceed the benefits of not having to pay the EU membership fee. The “divorce bill” agreed by Theresa May’s government already includes the UK’s normal payments into the EU budget until December 2020. The legislation currently before Parliament itself proposes an extension only until January 2020 (although the EU could propose a different extension, which could itself be rejected by Parliament.) As such, any payments into the EU budget following an extension in this period would reduce the final “divorce bill” paid upon leaving the EU by the same amount. Leaving with a deal in January 2020 wouldn’t cost more in EU budget contributions than leaving with a deal in October 2019 would. This has already happened once: the original settlement was around £39 billion, but this is now down to £33 billion, largely as a result of extending Brexit from March to October this year.  The government could of course plan to try and renegotiate this financial settlement before October 31, but we aren’t aware of any indication so far that they hope to do this. In his Radio 4 interview, Mr. Raab said that the government had a “targeted ask” in negotiations, which was removing the Irish backstop. If Mr. Raab is comparing the cost of any extension to a no deal exit at the end of October, then his figure of £1 billion for monthly EU contributions is in the right ballpark. However, as BBC Reality Check has pointed out, this doesn’t factor in payments received from the EU, which would reduce the amount by about a quarter. It’s also not entirely clear that leaving with no deal would mean we could avoid paying the “divorce bill”, something which Boris Johnson has said several times would be his plan in a no deal scenario. When we looked at this question earlier this year, we found that under international law it’s not clearly set out that the UK has to pay anything once it has left the EU. However, the EU would be within its rights to take the case to the International Court of Justice on the grounds of the UK’s repeated commitments to pay, and the outcome of such a case would be hard to predict. It’s not necessarily wrong to compare the potential cost of an extension to a no deal exit - but it’s potentially misleading to do so given that in the same interview Mr Raab restated that the government’s plan is to leave with a deal (“The prime minister’s been very clear, we want a deal” he said on Radio 4). And if you were making such a comparison, you should factor in the fact that no deal exit will itself have costs.","This is only compared to a no deal exit in which the UK refuses to pay the “divorce bill”, and it doesn’t include payments back from the EU to the UK. If we leave with a deal, any extension up to the end of 2020 will not cost us extra, as the agreed financial settlement already includes these payments.

54,fullfact,"Under Boris Johnson’s planned withdrawal agreement GDP per capita would fall by up to 7% in 10 years.
","“Mr Johnson’s plan is also a much harder Brexit than Theresa May’s.” “GDP per capita would fall by up to 7% in 10 years, says the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank.” Daily Mirror, 17 October 2019 Today, the Mirror cited analysis by think tank UK in a Changing Europe, claiming it said GDP per capita would fall by 7% over 10 years under the Prime Minister’s plans for an EU withdrawal agreement. This misses crucial context, meaning it’s misleading. UK in a Changing Europe said that GDP per person would grow by 7% less under Boris Johnson’s deal after ten years compared to a scenario where the UK remains in the EU and maintains the status quo. It did not find that GDP would fall by 7% over the ten years. That could well mean that the UK economy still grows over this period, but more slowly than if we remained in the EU. This isn’t the first example of people wrongly assuming that forecasts of Brexit’s negative impact on GDP equate to a fall in GDP compared to where it is now. UK in a Changing Europe wrote: “[We do not] attempt to forecast how much the UK economy will grow over the next ten years. “Rather, we address the narrower question of the change in the UK’s income per capita if the future relationship with the EU were based on Mr Johnson’s proposals. It’s worth noting that UK in a Changing Europe modelled numerous scenarios. A 7% fall in GDP per capita is under a system where the UK has a restrictive migration policy and productivity is affected. The scenario in which GDP is least affected is where there is a liberal migration policy and productivity is not affected. This, UK in a Changing Europe estimates, would reduce GDP by 2.3% over a ten year period compared to remaining in the EU.","Incorrect. This misreports an estimate by think tank UK in a Changing Europe. It estimated that, in one scenario, GDP per capita would be 7% lower after 10 years, compared to if the UK remained in the EU—not 7% lower than it is now.

55,fullfact,"New analysis shows that the UK will be £135 billion richer with no deal.
","“New Brexit Analysis Humiliates Remainers As UK Will Be £135bn Richer With No Deal” The British Journal, 8 July 2019 An article on the website The British Journal, dated 8 July 2019, says “the latest report by the Economists for Free Trade have calculated that the opportunities from the UK going global under a “No Deal” Brexit may give the UK an extra £135 billion per year.” The article has received over 35,000 shares on Facebook (using analysis from Crowdtangle) since its publication earlier this month, but the report in question is not new—it was published two years ago. Many users may have mistaken it for genuinely breaking news though, because The British Journal originally published the article with the BBC’s old breaking news image. It has since changed this to a generic “breaking news” image. That matter aside, a wide range of other economists have criticised Economists for Free Trade’s estimate about the economic gains from a no deal Brexit. Two years ago Economists for Free Trade (EFT) claimed that the UK economy would be better off by “as much as £135 billion a year” if the UK left the EU without a deal and unilaterally eliminated all trade barriers, including tariffs on imports. Of the £135 billion, £80 billion was estimated to come from “free trade”, £40 billion from reducing regulation, £4 billion from reducing benefit payments to unskilled EU migrants, and £11 billion from no longer paying into the EU budget.   But a wide range of other economists have criticised the group’s estimates and we’ve looked at a few of their main points below. Much of the criticism of EFT’s calculation has focused on the points about “free trade”—where it identifies the bulk of the economic growth to come from. EFT’s argument is essentially that, if the UK left the EU on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms, it could remove all tariffs and non-tariff barriers on imports from anywhere in the world, which would reduce the prices paid by British consumers by 10%, which in turn would drive an upturn in the economy (GDP). The 10% figure has been criticised. Researchers at the London School of Economics (LSE) said the figure “comes from looking at the differences in price levels between the UK and some other countries and arguing that these higher prices are due to protectionism caused mainly by EU regulations (non-tariff barriers).” However, this argument ignores the possibility that prices in EU markets may be higher for other reasons, for example because EU consumers buy better quality products. The LSE continues: “say Europeans put a higher premium on high-quality clothing compared with Americans. It will look like Europeans are paying more for their clothes, but in reality, the higher average prices simply reflect a different mix of purchases.” Also the data used by the EFT comes from 2002, meaning the estimates are quite out of date. Economists have also challenged the EFT’s assumption that UK exporters would not face increased non-tariff barriers to trade with the EU if we left on WTO terms. The Institute for Government describes this assumption as “extreme”. Non-tariff barriers are things like regulatory standards which trading partners have to comply with. They can limit the amount of trade which two countries are able to do together. It is estimated that the non-tariff barriers faced by non-EU members exporting to the EU range from 7%-21% of the value of those goods (whereas members of the EU single market don’t face such barriers when trading with one another). The EFT acknowledges this, yet believes that UK exporters would not face new non-tariff barriers if the UK left the EU on WTO terms because WTO rules wouldn’t allow it.  The Institute for Government says: “WTO law is not strong enough to compel the EU to abandon the legal requirements of the Single Market”, a finding supported by trade law experts. This would mean the UK would likely face significant non-tariff barriers on exports to the EU if it adopted the policy proposed by EFT.","The analysis in question is two years old, and claims that GDP would grow by £135 billion if the UK unilaterally removed all barriers to international trade after Brexit. The analysis has been criticised by other economists, especially for its argument that the UK would not face new non-tariff barriers to trade with the EU in this scenario.

56,fullfact,"The vast majority of the public strongly objects to the government’s plan to pay £39 billion to Brussels.
","   The pub chain JD Wetherspoon has recently distributed beer mats in its pubs making a number of claims about the EU and outlining what Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin thinks the UK government’s Brexit policy should be. These beer mats have also been the subject of a number of news articles. We were asked by Full Fact readers to see if these claims stack up. The initial claim - that 'Free Trade' and 'No Deal' mean the same thing - is misleading. Exiting the EU without a deal wouldn't necessarily mean that the UK would adopt a particular trade policy afterwards; it would mean that the government would have the option to adopt it, within the constraints of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. There have been calls for the UK in a no-deal scenario to follow the lead of countries like Singapore to operate with few, if any, import tariffs. However, this is not currently government policy, and it's also possible that the government could choose to raise import duties following a no-deal Brexit. The UK government is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU, and the shape of the UK and the EU’s future relationship. The UK's aims include what it calls a “deep and comprehensive economic partnership”, with the EU, including establishing a “free trade area for goods”.  At the moment, the UK is part of the EU Customs Union. This means we can’t face or impose tariffs (which are like taxes) on our trade with other countries in the customs union. The EU does set some tariffs on trade that comes in from the rest of the world, outside the customs union, which means some UK imports face tariffs too. That’s unless the EU has a specific trade agreement with the countries involved. It also waives tariffs on most goods from almost 50 developing countries under its Everything But Arms policy.  If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal in place we would trade with the EU under the rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation: an international body which regulates world trade. This is what people mean by trading “under WTO terms” or a “no deal Brexit”. This means the UK could remove tariffs on some goods that currently face them via the EU. It’s generally accepted that reducing tariffs in and of itself lowers consumer prices: after all, these are an additional tax on products. There’s inherent uncertainty to any predictions, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has estimated that abolishing tariffs entirely could reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7–1.2%. But tariffs are just one factor that impacts on the prices that consumers actually pay.         Removing tariffs like this is only possible if the UK leaves the EU’s customs union. Doing this would likely lead to the need for new checks on goods moving between the UK and the EU, which would introduce new costs on this trade. The IFS concludes that these new costs would probably be greater than the limited savings from abolishing tariffs: leading to higher costs for consumers. The UK government has recently published a series of guidance notes explaining how people should prepare for a no-deal Brexit, giving some clarity as to what these “non-tariff barriers” would look like. The trade guidance it has published suggests that businesses might consider buying new software or hiring “a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider” to help them navigate these new requirements.  In a poll conducted by ICM on behalf of the Guardian in August 2017, respondents were asked whether they thought that “paying an ‘exit fee’ of up to £40bn … as the UK’s contribution to spending commitments made by the UK when the UK was a member” was acceptable or unacceptable. 75% said they thought it was unacceptable. Polling organisation YouGov has noted that people’s responses to this question seem to depend a lot on how the question is framed. Respondents tend to be more supportive of the lower figure in a range of options and less supportive of higher figures. In this case the £40 billion was the highest figure provided. The size of the UK’s “divorce bill” with the EU is estimated to be £35-39 billion. We’ve written more about that here. Dividing £39 billion by the population of the UK and the number of MPs does give you about “£600 for every man, woman and child in the UK — or £60 million per MP”. A House of Lords report has argued that legally the UK isn’t required to pay a penny. This has been disputed by some legal experts, and the report itself acknowledges that there are “competing interpretations”. The Institute for Government has suggested that, if the UK refused to pay the exit fee, the EU might seek redress through the International Court of Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The UK Government collects tariff revenues on goods it imports from states that don’t have tariff-free trade with the EU, and contributes this to the EU budget, after keeping 20% of this money to cover “collection costs”. The UK then receives a proportion of its contribution to the EU budget back in EU-funded projects in the UK (just less than half in 2017), though less than many other member countries.   This 93% figure seems to refer to the proportion of the world’s population that is in not in the EU, and is correct. Another way of considering this issue is the proportion of the world’s economic activity (measured in GDP) that is accounted for outside of the EU: an estimated 78% in 2016. Whether consumers would want to swap EU goods like champagne for English sparkling wine is a matter for them. This isn’t a straightforward claim, and there’s no definitive way of measuring the impact that tariff changes might have had on those countries’ economies. Nor is there an easy way of summarising how low a country’s tariffs are, because they can vary a lot. One way to compare what sort of tariffs different countries charge on their imports is to compare their average World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs. This isn’t a perfect measure of how “free” a country’s trade is, as it doesn’t take account of any preferential trade agreements that individual countries or groups of countries have negotiated. In the case of the EU, for example, most trade takes place with countries that have negotiated improvements on these WTO rates. It also doesn’t tell you anything about trade in services. This isn’t subject to tariffs, but can face other non-tariff barriers to cross-border trade. Countries have two sets of tariffs: “bound tariffs” and “Most Favoured Nation” (MFN) tariffs. The bound tariff is the “upper bound”: the amount that countries have pledged to the WTO that they won’t exceed. The MFN tariffs are the ones that are generally used, and must be applied to all WTO members a trade agreement isn’t in place with. In WTO parlance this means that all countries are treated the same as the “Most Favoured Nation”. There can be a large discrepancy between these two figures. Hong Kong is the only place in the world to remove all of its tariffs, and in general, agricultural goods are subject to higher tariffs than other goods. Switzerland’s average MFN tariff, for example, is increased by the high tariffs it applies to agricultural products: on average 35%. Singapore’s average MFN tariff is zero, but this hides two details. One is that it retains a small average tariff on beverages and tobacco: 1.6%. The other is that it has a much higher average “bound tariff” of 9.4%: the level that the country can raise its tariffs to without breaking WTO rules.  Both the USA and India have expressed interest in agreeing trade deals with the UK. These will be complex to negotiate and will require the UK government to make trade-offs. For example, in a trade deal with the US, how much would the UK want to coordinate the two countries' very different regulatory systems (the prospect of chlorine-washed chicken for sale in the UK is often raised as a concern by UK consumers)? And in a trade deal with India, would the UK want to ease immigration rules for Indian workers?    It is generally thought that new trade deals will take the UK several years, at the very least, to negotiate. The more these trade deals seek to do—for example, the more non-tariff barriers they seek to eliminate—the longer they will take. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact  ","A poll found that 75% of respondents said paying an EU exit fee of up to £40 billion was unacceptable. But responses to these questions depend on how the question is framed.

57,fullfact,"The prime minister’s Chequers deal is more unpopular than the Poll Tax.
"," “The Chequers deal is now more unpopular with the British people than the Poll Tax was.” Justine Greening MP, 3 September 2018 “The Prime Minister’s Chequers plan is even more unpopular than the Poll Tax.” Ian Blackford MP, 5 September 2018 In recent days politicians from several parties have said that the so-called ‘Chequers deal’—the current cabinet-endorsed negotiating position on Brexit—is less popular than the ‘Poll Tax’, the widely-protested tax introduced by Margaret Thatcher’s government. It’s true that, according to recent polls, the percentage of people who say they support the Chequers deal (18%) is lower than the percentage who supported the Poll Tax at its least popular (19%), although based on a poll that’s such a small difference we can’t know for sure that Chequers has smaller support levels. The most common way of measuring popularity, however, is to look at the difference between positive and negative opinions. By this measure, the Poll Tax (with a net approval of -57% at its least popular) was far more unpopular than the Chequers deal (net approval -34%), as many more people actively opposed it. A large percentage of people say they don’t know what they think of the Chequers deal. The ‘Poll Tax’ – officially known as the ‘Community Charge’ – was a new local government flat tax introduced by Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government, to replace the previous system of council ‘rates’. It came into force in Scotland at the beginning of the 1989 financial year, and then in England and Wales a year later in 1990. The tax was extremely unpopular, sparking widespread protests, riots and co-ordinated non-payment campaigns. Opposition to the tax (and the damage it was having on Conservative polling figures) was a major factor the leadership challenge that forced Margaret Thatcher to resign in November 1990. Polling firm Ipsos MORI has historical opinion poll figures covering several years from when the Poll Tax was first proposed, until its introduction in England and Wales in the spring of 1990. This data shows that opposition to the tax peaked in March 1990, shortly before it was due to come into force in England and Wales, when only 19% of people approved of it and 76% disapproved, a net approval of -57%. The ‘Chequers deal’ or ‘Chequers plan’ is the common term for the Brexit negotiating position agreed by the cabinet during a meeting at Chequers (the prime minister’s country residence) in early July. It was immediately controversial, and prompted the resignation of several pro-Brexit cabinet ministers who opposed it, including the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. A poll by Sky Data on September 4 found that 18% of people approved of the deal, while 52% disapproved (with 30% responding ‘don’t know’). Earlier polling by YouGov, which asked a slightly different question, showed that only 13% of people thought the deal would be “good for Britain” compared to 42% who thought it would “not be good for Britain” (44% responded ‘don’t know’). Here we’ll use the Sky Data figures, both because they are the most recent, and because the question they asked is most comparable to that asked about the Poll Tax. While the level of support for the Chequers deal is marginally below that of the Poll Tax (although within the polling margin of error), the level of opposition to it is significantly lower, by 24%. This is reflected in the fact that the percentage of ‘don’t knows’ is far higher for the Chequers deal, at 30% compared to just 5% for the Poll Tax. This means that the net approval for the Poll Tax at its worst was -57%, while that for the Chequers Deal is -34%. Over the years that Ipsos MORI polled, the Poll Tax regularly had net approval ratings below the current level for the Chequers deal. So while the low level of support for the Chequers deal is comparable to the Poll Tax at its least popular, it’s not accurate to say that it is “more unpopular”. When considering the number of ‘don’t know’ responses, it’s worth noting that with the Poll Tax the proportion of ‘don’t knows’ decreased as the policy came closer to being implemented. It’s also worth noting that people can dislike the Chequers deal for opposing reasons: some Leave supporters think the form of Brexit it proposes is too ‘soft’, while Remain supporters may oppose it because it is still a plan for Brexit.","Not quite. Recent polling suggests that the Chequers deal is supported by fewer people than the Poll Tax was at its least popular, but fewer people also oppose it outright.

58,fullfact,"Public opinion is swinging in favour of having a second referendum on Brexit.
","“Public opinion is clearly swinging in favour of having a people's vote.” Vince Cable, September 20 2018 “There isn’t any evidence for that… Sir John Curtice, who’s like Britain’s leading pollster,  today said there is absolutely no evidence of a swing in favour of a second referendum.” Camilla Tominey, September 20 2018 There is some evidence that public opinion has swung towards a referendum on the final Brexit deal, although there is significant disagreement between polls. It’s not right to claim that Sir John Curtice has said there’s ""absolutely no evidence"" for it - he has said the evidence is not ""consistent"". This means it is still not entirely clear what the trend is, and whether a majority of the public back a second vote. As Professor Curtice has said, the uncertainty comes from the fact that polling responses can differ significantly depending on exactly what question is asked, and what the options for a hypothetical referendum would be. Professor Sir John Curtice is a political scientist at Strathclyde University and the National Centre for Social Research, and is widely regarded as one of the UK’s leading authorities on polling (and who has become well-known thanks to his regular appearances on the BBC). We haven’t been able to find any recent comments from him that suggest “there is absolutely no evidence of a swing in favour of a second referendum”. He did tell the BBC on September 20 that “there is no consistent evidence of a shift in support for a second referendum"" - which isn’t quite the same.  ""There is no consistent evidence of a shift in support for a second referendum"" Prof John Curtice told #factcheckjoel after #politicslive guests made claims about calls for a further votehttps://t.co/iR09IQOEQt #politicslive pic.twitter.com/8DJfXbcbBY He has also repeatedly written in the past month that there is some evidence for such a swing. However, he has cautioned that different polls give very different results, and that it is unclear whether a majority of the public currently support it - hence his comment that the evidence isn't consistent. On August 28, he wrote for the What UK Thinks: EU site that “while there is some evidence that Chequers may have persuaded a few more voters of the merits of holding another ballot, we probably need more instances of the same question showing an increase in support since before the beginning of July before we can be sure that this is indeed what has happened.” Some weeks later on September 18, he wrote for the BBC: “This idea [a referendum on the final deal] has gradually become more popular - even more so in the wake of the Chequers agreement. But there may still not be a majority in favour.” And the following day he tweeted that some polls show a shift towards a second vote, but others do not:  Is support for holding #euref2 increasing as claimed today by @peoplesvote_uk? Some polls say yes - but others don't. https://t.co/jjpnWjT67E; https://t.co/pjipNWSbAh; https://t.co/dcfRycXgC6 & https://t.co/wHWH2q2y1w Public opinion over whether a second vote should be held the final deal agreed for exiting the EU is complicated by two main factors. One is how the opinion poll phrases the question, and the other is what options the hypothetical referendum would present to the voters. As Professor Curtice wrote in his August 28 post, people’s responses seem to differ depending on whether they are asked about a “second referendum”, or whether they are asked if “the public” should have a vote on the “deal”. And because different polling companies have asked different questions at different times, it is hard to say with certainty how public opinion has shifted. Polls that mention “the public” having a vote on the “deal” (such as these from Opinium and these from BMG Research) have generally been more likely to show a majority in support of the vote. Polls that use the phrase “second referendum” (such as this, also from Opinium) have generally been more likely to show a majority opposed to the vote. The other issue is that there is no consensus on what options would be included in such a referendum. It could be a two-way choice between the final deal and remaining in the EU; a two-way choice between the final deal and leaving with no deal; or a three-way choice between the final deal, no deal, or remaining. As Professor Curtice says, Remain supporters are (probably unsurprisingly) more likely to back a choice between the final deal and remaining, while Leave supporters are more likely to back a choice between the final deal and no deal. One polling company, YouGov, has consistently asked the same question at regular intervals over the past year, which gives us the best opportunity to see if there is a long-term trend. Their question is “Once the Brexit negotiations are complete and the terms of Britain's exit from the EU have been agreed, do you think there should or should not be a referendum to accept or reject them?”. The polling since April 2017 suggests that there has been a shift in favour of a second referendum - from a clear majority against a second vote a year ago, to a roughly even split in recent polls.This has to be interpreted in light of the caveats mentioned above: the phrasing of the YouGov question has generally prompted responses more opposed to a second referendum than other polling, and it still doesn’t show a clear majority in favour. Conversely, some polls that have generally shown a majority in favour of a public vote on the deal have shown a slight move in the other direction, although they still show clear majorities supporting a referendum. The only other regular poll we’re aware of that consistently showed a majority opposed to a second referendum, from Opinium, has not polled on that question since the Chequers meeting that agreed the government’s negotiating position. On the balance of the evidence, it does seem more likely than not that there has been some shift of public opinion in favour of a referendum on the final deal - but it is not consistent across different polls, depends heavily on how the question is phrased, and it’s hard to say how large the shift (if any) has been.","There is some polling evidence of a shift in public opinion towards another referendum, but different polls have given inconsistent results, and results can vary a lot depending on what question is asked.

59,fullfact,"Polling figures show that Theresa May’s Brexit approach is ‘pissing off most of the nation’.
","This week Leave.eu, an organisation campaigning for Brexit, circulated figures about public sentiment towards the Chequers deal and the Government’s approach to Brexit negotiations. But these figures don’t refer to the survey’s results from general public as a whole – they are for Leave voters only. When you look at all adults across England, Scotland and Wales, according to the survey it’s still the case that more people are dissatisfied with the government’s Chequers deal than satisfied, but to a lesser extent.  Leave voters are about as dissatisfied with the government’s general negotiating approach as the general population.   The data comes from a YouGov/Times survey of a representative group of British adults on the ongoing Brexit negotiations—specifically the so-called “Chequers deal”. It found that more people are not in favour of the deal than in favour of the deal. It also found that 40% of adults in Great Britain thought the deal was too soft, 12% thought it was too hard, 13% thought the balance was right, and the remaining 35% answered “none of these” or “don’t know”.  The data in the claim which showed a majority opposing the deal looked only at the results of the people surveyed who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum. The post referred to Theresa May “pissing off most of the nation”. While it’s true that leave voters were “most” of the people who voted in the 2016 referendum, Leave voters are not “most of the nation”. In mid-2016 there were an estimated 52 million adults in the UK, of whom 17 million (34%) voted leave. So it’s inaccurate to use figures for Leave voters only to describe “most of the nation”. Leave voters are more negative about the deal than the population as a whole, and according to this survey, a majority of them (54%) would be unhappy if the Chequers deal went ahead. They’re also less likely to think the deal hit the right balance between “soft” and “hard” Brexit. Nevertheless across the population far more people appear to be unhappy   with the Chequers deal than are happy with it (no matter which way the voted in the referendum). And a large majority of those surveyed (75%) think that the government is handling Brexit negotiations either “fairly badly” or “very badly”.  As with all surveys, there is a margin of error with the data. YouGov designed the survey, to ensure the views of the people it surveyed represent the views of the public, through sampling and weighting. However there are some factors that it’s still worth bearing in mind.   This survey only covers adults in Great Britain. So the people of Northern Ireland are not represented. Northern Ireland as a whole voted for Remain (unlike Great Britain) and issues around the Irish border may mean that Northern Irish people view the Chequers deal and ongoing negotiations in a different way from the rest of the UK. Therefore excluding their views on the deal and negotiations may skew the results of the data overall. Also, there are fewer non-voters included in the survey than in the general population, it counts around 1,420 voters out of the total sample of 1,730— a turnout of 82% among all adults in Great Britain. The turnout among registered voters on the day of the EU referendum was only 72% among registered voters. Non-voters surveyed were more likely to answer “don’t know” to the survey questions. So under-representing their views may also have skewed the results away from the “don’t know” responses. YouGov told us it deliberately doesn’t include as many non-voters as were observed in the referendum for two reasons. Firstly, it expects that some of the 1,420 people saying in the survey they voted Remain or Leave, did not in fact vote. Secondly it questioned the 72% turnout figure saying incompleteness, inaccuracy and double-registration in the register mean that the turnout could have in fact been higher than 72%. Though it did say this could have improved following the move from household electoral registration to individual electoral registration in 2014.

60,fullfact,"Millions of people who voted Leave did not vote for Theresa May’s hard Brexit.
","“There were also millions of people who voted Leave but did not vote for Theresa May's hard Brexit” Jo Swinson, 27 April 2017 There has been lots of commentary on who voted for each side in the EU referendum and why. We’re focusing specifically here on people’s expectations in relation to a ‘hard Brexit’, as Ms Swinson referred to.  The term “hard Brexit” means different things to different people, but it’s generally used to mean at the very least leaving the EU’s single market (as Ms Swinson referred to).  Theresa May has said this is the only way to control things like immigration. EU officials say this as well. This is because EU free trade rules for the single market require free movement of people between member countries. At the start of the year a majority of both Remain and Leave voters said they wanted both free trade and immigration control, says an in-depth study by polling expert Professor John Curtice.  The disagreement comes in what voters prioritise. Faced with a choice over whether free trade or immigration control comes first, as many as 36% of Leave supporters said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ maintain freedom of movement in return for free trade, compared to 74% of Remain voters, at least when confronted out of the blue by a pollster.   At least half of Remain voters were found to back some policies that the research defined as parts of a hard Brexit as well.  This is all debatable. There is no set definition of a hard and soft Brexit, and we don’t yet know what the trade offs will be during the negotiations.  What this polling does show is that we should beware of making strong claims about what voters on either side think: there are Remainers sympathising with “Leave” positions, and Leavers sympathising with “Remain” positions.    For a broader examination of the reasons behind voters’ decisions last June, social researchers at NatCen have published extensive analysis. Update 28 June 2017  We updated the wording of the piece to make it clearer and to emphasise the limitations of what the polling is able to tell us.

More recent polling could be used to show this—if being against a “hard Brexit” is defined as prioritising free trade over immigration control.

61,fullfact,"Options for post-Brexit trade deals with the EU will lead to between 2% and 8% lower GDP.
","This graphic has been shared widely on social media. Just one tweet sharing it has received over 15,000 retweets at the time of writing. It’s based on government analysis, produced in January, of three possible post-Brexit trade scenarios with the EU (none of the three possible deals are as detailed as the government's recent white paper on the matter). The analysis compares how each deal might affect the economy. The graphic’s reporting of the analysis is highly misleading. For a start, the government report explicitly states that it’s based on hypothetical modelling and should not be used to make economic forecasts for each trade deal. This means it can’t be used—as the graphic does—to estimate the future size of GDP, or number of jobs. Even if we ignore this, most of the figures reported by the graphic are still incorrect. The GDP figures are roughly accurate, but the phrasing may be confusing—the government analysis still expects GDP to grow in each scenario, just more slowly. So “8% lower GDP” under “no deal” means GDP will still have grown, but more slowly than on the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) latest economic forecasts, over a fifteen year period. The “less per year” figures are wrong, as they refer to the how much less the economy might grow by over fifteen years, not every year. And there is no evidence for the estimated job losses they report in either the government analysis or wider research. To begin with, it’s important to clarify that the government analysis on which this graphic is based explicitly says that this is not a forecast for what will actually happen to the economy in each scenario. It’s only to give a comparative sense of each deal’s potential impact. The government uses the OBR's current economic forecasts up to 2023 (and then extrapolates them over 15 years) in order to create a baseline for economic growth. They then model three different Brexit scenarios against this baseline, and show how GDP growth varies in each one. But the report recognises that future economic uncertainty could affect the analysis, and also that it doesn’t account for short-term impacts from Brexit—so it’s not an official economic forecast for each trade deal. Although it’s not a forecast, the analysis does give an indication of the comparative impact of different trade deals. GDP is not expected to fall in any of the three Brexit scenarios, but it is expected to grow more slowly in each scenario over a 15 year period (with the caveats outlined above about the uncertain path of growth, and there being no modelling of short-term impacts). For instance, growth is expected to be around 17% over 15 years based on the no deal model, compared to 25% on the baseline model. Put another way, that’s 1.1% average growth each year in the no deal model, compared to 1.5% on the baseline. These estimates are also mid-points within quite wide ranges. This means that growth in the no deal scenario is estimated to be anywhere between 5% and 10% slower. (For the sake of clarity, this article focuses mainly on how the graphic reports the no deal scenario, but the issues with the calculations apply to all three trade deals equally.) The graphic tries to translate the different GDP growth rates into costs to the economy. This can’t be done fairly because the analysis is explicitly not an economic forecast, but even if you ignore this factor, the graphic’s estimates are still incorrect. It says that the no deal scenario will mean the economy having “£158 billion less per year”. This is actually how much less the economy might grow by over a fifteen year period, not one year. Using the 2017 GDP estimate from the Office for National Statistics, if the economy grew by 17% over the next 15 years (as the no deal model roughly estimates), by the fifteenth year GDP would be around £155 billion less than if it had grown by 25%. But in each year before that the shortfall would be less, so it’s wrong to say that this is the figure lost “per year” We don’t know what the impact of Brexit will be on jobs, but there’s no evidence in the government report to support the graphic’s calculations (which is where the makers of this graphic say their information is from). Separate research has suggested that a “pessimistic” no deal scenario could lead to significantly fewer jobs by 2030 (we haven’t verified these calculations), but it’s still nowhere near the 2.8 million figure claimed here. The graphic seems to directly translate the estimated difference in GDP growth rates in each scenario into an equivalent difference in the number of jobs. So an 8% slower GDP growth rate under no deal is equated to 8% fewer jobs, which they calculate as 2.8 million fewer jobs. (They don’t specify if this is job losses, or simply a slower increase in the rate of jobs, nor what time period this relates to.) But that’s not how the growth rates of GDP and jobs are related. 2.8 million jobs lost over 15 years, while the economy continues to grow, would be unprecedented. If the assumption is that jobs continue to rise, but by 2.8 million less, then the implication is that the rate of jobs growth and the rate of GDP growth are identical. That’s not how it works. The graph below shows that, while changes in GDP growth and job numbers generally track each other, GDP tends to rise and fall more sharply than jobs. As an illustration of how unlikely it is that GDP growth and jobs growth would exactly match each other, as this claim assumes: if jobs grew at the rate GDP is expected to grow under the baseline model, then within the next few decades there would be millions more jobs than there were adults of working age in the country (based on the ONS’s population projections). Which is pretty implausible, even if lots of people work two jobs. It should also be noted that the scenarios modelled by the government report are all quite general. They don’t have anything like the level of detail that, for instance, the government’s Brexit white paper has, in terms of the minutiae of trade agreements. Any Brexit deal we do strike will not exactly resemble the EEA-Type or FTA-Type scenarios of the report. And neither do the OBR’s forecasts, used as a baseline in the report, amount to a “remain” scenario, as the graphic suggests. The OBR forecasts are based on economic projections for the UK at present—a country which is in the process of leaving the EU, having triggered Article 50 and committed vast governmental resources to planning and negotiating Brexit—not a hypothetical scenario in which we decide to remain in the EU.","This is based on government analysis of 3 hypothetical deals, which explicitly can’t be used as economic forecasts and are very uncertain. According to the analysis GDP will continue to grow over the next fifteen years in each case, but more slowly than on existing OBR projections.

62,fullfact,"The Institute for Public Policy Research found household bills will rise by between £245 and £1,961 a year after Brexit.
","“The Institute for Public Policy Research found household bills will rise by between £245 and £1,961 a year after #Brexit, with a disproportionately adverse impact on lower-income groups and regions outside London.” Renew Party, 18 July 2018.  This is a case of a series of crossed wires. The estimated household cost increase following a “hard Brexit” was £961, not £1,961, and was calculated by consultancy Oliver Wyman, not think tank The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). Oliver Wyman estimated that a “hard Brexit” scenario with World Trade Organisation tariffs would add 4%, or £961, onto average annual household costs. The Brexit scenario with the lowest impact on bills (a “moderate amount of red tape” scenario”) would increase annual household costs by 1% or £245, as the graphic correctly states. The £1,961 figure originates from a typo in an article by the Guardian which has since been corrected. That article discussed both the Oliver Wyman report and a separate report by the IPPR looking at the possible effects of Brexit on income inequality, which may be the source of confusion. The claim that IPPR said Brexit will have a disproportionately adverse impact on lower-income groups and regions outside London isn’t quite right. In fact the IPPR said that “price impacts have a broadly neutral effect on income inequality”, adding that “while Brexit is unlikely to worsen income inequality, all income groups – including the poorest - will face negative impacts.” They do however note that lower income households have “less of a ‘buffer’ to protect them from increased prices”. The Oliver Wyman report said a “hard Brexit” scenario could increase costs for low-income households by 3% more than high income-households. They also said a different scenario, with increased labour costs, could flip that situation – with household costs for higher earners increasing by 4% more than for lower earners.   As for geographical inequality, the IPPR said the regional effects of Brexit on jobs are hard to determine with certainty but that “most studies suggest that in the long run it is areas outside London and the South East that are most likely to suffer from a downturn.” With regards to household costs, it estimated that regions outside London would be most affected saying: “London is least affected because a greater proportion of households’ expenditure goes on housing costs, which are not expected to be significantly impacted by Brexit.” Nevertheless it acknowledged dissenting views such as analysis from the London School of Economics which, on jobs, said that service sectors would be more negatively affected by Brexit than other sectors, and that because London and the South East have the highest concentration of services industries, those regions will be hit the hardest by Brexit. The IPPR concluded by saying: “Our analysis suggests that claims that Brexit will benefit the worst off or entrench inequalities further as too simplistic. The available research suggests that exiting the EU – in particular a hard Brexit – will have a negative GVA and price impact across different income groups, regions, genders and ethnicities, but it will not necessarily increase inequalities.”","Incorrect. Consultancy Oliver Wyman (not the IPPR) estimate household bills will rise by between £245 and £961 (not £1,961) a year after Brexit. The figure of £1,961 was a typo in a newspaper.

63,fullfact,"Most of our trade with the world is based on WTO rules.
","“There are WTO rules which govern world trade, and most of our dealings with most countries in the world are based on WTO rules.” Charles Moore, 12 July 2018 Most of the UK’s trade is with the EU or countries the EU has trade agreements with—about 57% of our exports and 66% of our imports in 2016. That means it doesn’t happen under standard World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. But EU trade agreements don’t affect tariffs on all goods and services. Some goods and services have the same tariff level for countries the EU has trade agreements with and those it doesn’t. If the UK were to leave the EU with “no deal”, we would go back to trading under WTO terms with these countries. In a nutshell, the WTO is an international organisation aiming to reduce all barriers to trade. Most countries around the world are members, including the UK. The WTO requires member countries to apply tariffs (taxes) on goods and services to other WTO countries equally. It also means you can’t set different rules for foreign and domestic products in your country. The big exception is if countries have negotiated their own customs union or free trade area. You can read more about how the WTO works here. The main exception to WTO trade rules that apply to the UK is that we’re a member of the EU customs union and so have free trade with other EU members. In 2016 44% of our exports in goods and services went to other EU countries and 54% of our goods and services imports came from EU countries. The EU also has trade agreements with other countries, like Israel and South Korea.  Countries where there is an EU trade agreement in place accounted for a further 12% of our imports and 13% of our exports. The EU also has “preferential trade agreements” with various other countries. This is where one country grants preferential tariffs on imports from developing countries. As these arrangements are unilateral (they’re one way and so don’t require a two-way trade deal), we’ve not included these countries in our calculations. So in total 57% of our exports and 66% of our imports happen with countries we have some trade agreement with as part of the EU. The EU has also negotiated or is in the process of negotiating trade deals with other countries, including Japan and Australia.   Free trade agreements that change tariffs between countries from the WTO default don’t necessarily affect all goods and services. While 57% of the UK’s exports go to the EU or other countries with which we have some kind of trade agreement, that doesn’t mean that a “no deal” situation would mean new tariffs on 57% of our exports. For example, take bottled beer. At the moment the EU, and therefore the UK, has no trade deal with  the USA and it pays no tariffs on the bottled beer it exports there. If the UK was to revert to trading with the EU under WTO rules following Brexit, there would similarly be no tariffs on the export of UK bottled beer to the EU. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time.

64,fullfact,"Food, clothing and footwear make up the highest proportion of the poorest households’ spending.
","“When we leave, we can set our own tariffs. Tariffs set at the European level make food, clothing and footwear more expensive. They are the highest proportion of the poorest in society’s expenditure. If we can get rid of those tariffs, we help the worst off in society.” Jacob Rees-Mogg, 26 October 2017 It’s correct that, after leaving the EU customs union, the UK would be able to choose what tariffs—which are basically taxes on imports or exports—it puts on imports from other countries. The UK wouldn’t have a completely free hand to do this, however. At the moment, the UK can’t do this because the EU sets a Common External Tariff on anyone it doesn't have a trade deal with. Higher tariffs mean products can be more expensive after they’ve been imported. The EU sets relatively high import tariffs on agricultural products compared to everything else. The average EU tariff on agriculture was roughly 11% in 2016, compared to about 4% for other products. Tariffs on dairy products are as high as 36% on average, those on clothing can average just under 12%, and those on footwear face about 4%. Mr Rees-Mogg also claims food, drink and clothing make up the highest proportion of the poorest households’ spending. What makes up the biggest chunk depends on how you categorise different kinds of spending, but these items certainly make up a big part of what low earners spend each week. The latest figures for these are for 2015/16, from the Office for National Statistics. The lowest-earning 10% of households spend about 17% of their weekly income on food and non-alcoholic drinks. Another 4.5% goes on clothes and 4% goes on alcohol. Meanwhile a full 22% goes on housing and fuel. The highest-earning 10% are very different. They spend 7.5% on food and drink, 4% on clothes and 1.5% on alcohol. Their biggest items are transport (16%) and leisure (13.5%). So does this mean getting rid of tariffs will help the worst off? It’s likely that lower tariffs will help with the cost of certain products, but it’s also just one part of a bigger picture. Tariffs aren’t the only thing that will affect household incomes after Brexit. The value of the pound has fallen since the referendum, and that has increased pressure on food and drink prices for everyone. Despite previous inaccurate predictions (covered above), economists generally expect there to be a negative impact on the UK’s economic growth in the coming years as a result of leaving the EU. If that happens household incomes will be lower than they otherwise would have been. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","What makes up the biggest chunk depends on how you categorise people’s weekly spending. These items combined make up about a quarter of the poorest households’ spending.

65,fullfact,"There are more GPs in the NHS today than in 2015.
","“Today, we learned that GP numbers are experiencing their first sustained fall for 50 years.” Jeremy Corbyn, 8 May 2019 “There are actually more GPs in the NHS today than there were in 2015.” Theresa May, 8 May 2019 Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clashed at Prime Minister’s Questions over the number of GPs in the NHS. Both were correctly quoting their selected figures, but the problem was they were talking about two different measures. Mr Corbyn was referring to the findings of a new report by the Nuffield Trust think tank. It found that the number of fully qualified, permanent GPs across the UK, per 100,000 people, “has fallen in a sustained way for the first time since the 1960s.” The same trend is true just when looking at England in isolation. Mrs May was referring to the total number of GPs in England excluding locums. This figure went up by around 200 between September 2015 and 2018.     Both are using “headcounts” of GPs, and these figures don’t tell us anything about how many hours these GPs are working. There’s no way to account for this in Mr Corbyn’s figures as the data is limited, but it’s possible to account for this in the data Mrs May was using. Looked at this way it paints the opposite picture. The number of “full-time equivalent” GPs excluding locums fell by 330 over the same time period. Health is a devolved issue so the UK government is only responsible for services in England. Research by the Nuffield Trust found that the number of GPs per 100,000 people across the UK has fallen from a high of around 67 in 2009 to 60 in 2018. That’s a similar number of GPs per person today as there were in 2004. The last time there was a recorded drop in the number of GPs per 100,000 was in the 1960s—although the data from that time wasn’t published as regularly so we don’t have a complete picture of exactly what the numbers were doing. It fell from around 43 per 100,000 in 1964, to 42 in 1965, and just under 42 in 1970.  The figures exclude certain types of GPs: registrars (GPs in training), retainers (those on schemes to support people with a caring responsibility), and locums (GPs providing temporary cover). The Nuffield Trust also adds that its figures might underestimate the fall in GPs per person. Factors like an ageing population could mean that we need more GPs to keep up with demand. It also says the trends should be interpreted with some caution due to the fact that there are some data quality issues, figures from across the UK are not necessarily taken at the same time in every year, and the fact that in some years estimates had to be made as to the number of GPs in a small proportion of practices that didn’t report their staffing levels. There are also problems with the changing definitions of who is included in the figures over time which mean we should be cautious about comparisons. The trend is the same in England, but not in every part of the UK. In Northern Ireland the number of GPs per person has largely been rising in recent years. In Scotland, the overall number of GPs per person is higher than in the rest of the UK, but has also been falling since 2009 (though less sharply than across the UK as a whole). In Wales the trend has been largely flat in recent years.  The Department of Health and Social Care told us that Mrs May was referring to the headcount number of permanent GPs (all GPs excluding locums) in England. The number rose by 208 between September 2015 and September 2018 (the most recent comparable figures). That’s an increase of about half a percent. The trend in the number of GPs across England depends on how you count them. If you look at all GPs, including registrars and locums, the number increased by around 3,150 between September 2015 and 2018. If you exclude all registrars and locums then the number fell by 660. In other words locums and registrars are what’s increasing the number of GPs while within that picture the number of fully trained, permanent GPs is falling. Looking just at the headcount figure, or the total number of people employed in a role, doesn’t tell us much about the working capacity those people have. To do this we can look at the number of hours they all work and add these together to work out how many full-time roles they make up, known as the full-time equivalent (FTE). The number of FTE permanent GPs (the equivalent FTE measure of the type of GPs that Theresa May was counting), the number fell by 330 between September 2015 and 2018. Looking at all FTE GPs the number rose by 270 and excluding registrars and locums it fell by around 1,180. The data the Nuffield Trust based their report on only provides headcount figures, rather than FTE, as not all of the regions of the UK regularly publish data on FTE GPs.","Correct looking at the headcount of GPs (excluding locums) in England between September 2015 and 2018. Looking at the full-time equivalent number of this group, which gives a better idea of staffing levels, the numbers are falling.

66,fullfact,"There are 18 million GP appointments a year for self-treatable conditions.
","“NHS England said there are 18 million GP appointments and 2.1 million A&E visits for self-treatable conditions a year at a cost of £850 million to the NHS.” Daily Mirror, 12 February 2018 (p.5 of print edition) “There are 18 million GP appointments and 2.1 million visits to A&E every year for conditions that could be dealt with at home, costing £850 million.” The Times, 12 February 2018 These numbers were widely reported last week, but they’re quite rough and should be treated with some caution. We can’t comment on NHS England’s medical advice, but we can say that the estimated cost savings are based on limited evidence. We only have official estimates for how many GP appointments there were in total across England in 2008, and the proportion of these that are avoidable is based on a survey of GPs that may not be representative. 2.1 million attendances at A&E in 2016/17 resulted in no treatment being given, but we don’t know if this means they could have been self-treated. NHS Digital—which publishes the figures—says it has no data on how many patients had a self-treatable ailment. The uncertainty around these figures also means that the estimate of their cost is very rough. NHS England and Public Health England have launched a campaign which encourages patients to seek advice from a pharmacist when they have a minor ailment, instead of going to a GP or accident and emergency. The campaign is particularly aimed at parents and their children. NHS England estimates that this could “help free up GP time for sicker patients and help save the NHS around £850 million each year as well as save time for busy families”, and provide patients with more convenient, timely advice, according to a press release provided to Full Fact. There were estimated to be around 300 million GP appointments across England in 2008—the latest official figures we have. A report by the Primary Care Foundation and the NHS Alliance found that 6% of GP appointments in a 2015 study could have been avoided by patients going to the pharmacy instead (roughly 2%), or caring for themselves without clinical advice (roughly 4%). This would be around 18 million of the 300 million appointments. But that figure is quite rough. It’s based on just under 60 GPs self-reporting how many patient consultations they thought could have been avoided, covering around 5,000 appointments altogether. There’s no evidence that these GP appointments were representative of the wider GP sector as a whole, nor that the they were intended to be representative. There was also a lot of variation in the proportion of appointments that different GPs thought were avoidable. The number of GP appointments is also likely to have increased a lot in the last ten years, according to expert estimates. However, they also say it’s hard to know for certain. NHS England says that 2.1 million visits to A&E were “self-treatable” in 2016/17, and told us that this referred to the number of attendances where patients were given no treatment after arriving at A&E in England. NHS Digital—which publishes the figures—told us it didn’t have any figures on whether or not an A&E attendance could have been managed through self-care.   NHS England said that fewer avoidable appointments will free up GP time for sicker patients, and help to save money. Research done by experts at the University of Kent, for NHS England and the Department of Health, found that the average cost of a GP consultation in England in 2016/17 was £31. Based on this, NHS England estimates that the 18 million self-treatable appointments in 2016/17 cost around £560 million. But the uncertainty around the number of avoidable appointments in the first place also makes this figure problematic. The average cost to the NHS in England of someone attending A&E was £148 in 2016/17, according to figures from NHS Improvement. This, multiplied by the number of A&E appointments that year where no guidance was given, comes to £310 million. This assumes this type of A&E attendance costs the same as the average. The Nuffield Trust also told us that reducing the number of GP and A&E visits might not lead to significant cost reductions. The average cost of an appointment factors in paying staff and occupying the premises, so fewer appointments won’t lead to financial savings unless resources such as the number of staff or buildings used to provide them can be reduced too. Update 19 February 2018  We added the second line of the article to state that we’re not commenting on NHS England’s medical advice, and we removed a final section linking to other organisations’ comments on the announcement.","This is a very rough figure based on uncertain and out of date data. It uses self-reported data from about 60 GPs on 5,000 appointments in 2015, and applies this to the total number of GP appointments in 2008.

","“Now you need to PROVE you need to see the doctor: Hundreds of GPs are assessing patients in three-minute phone calls before granting face-to-face appointments” Daily Mail, 28 November 2016 We haven’t seen evidence that GPs are asking patients to prove they need to see them over the phone, although the Daily Mail’s headline does reflect some doctors’ concerns about the quality of care provided through ‘telephone triage’ systems. The Mail reports that about 180 GP surgeries are using this approach systematically as a way to manage high demand for their services (that's out of about 7,700 practices in England). Instead of booking an initial face-to-face appointment or receiving an initial call from a nurse, patients are called by a GP who carries out an initial consultation over the phone.   The approach isn’t completely unusual: 12% of GP consultations take place over the phone, according to a 2014 study published in the Lancet medical journal. The idea is to prioritise face-to-face appointments with patients who seem to need help most urgently, and to avoid unnecessary ones. Feedback from surgeries that have tried this approach suggests that many patients are actually quite happy to receive quick advice over the phone instead of coming in to the surgery. So the approach isn’t designed to cruelly ration access to GPs. People have a right to register with an NHS surgery and a right to treatment by a GP at that surgery. GP Access and Productive Primary Healthcare, two firms that promote telephone triage systems, told us that they had never heard of a case where a GP refused a face-to-face appointment when the patient asked for one during the telephone call. The Mail’s story also refers to “three-minute phone assessments”. Productive Primary Healthcare told us that three minutes was the average length of a call once surgeries had implemented their system, but stressed that it doesn’t advise that calls be a particular length or have a time limit. GP Access said the same, although it bases its training for surgeries on an average call length of five minutes. Of course, none of this guarantees that some patients don’t feel ‘fobbed off’ by telephone consultations, as campaigners quoted by the Mail put it, or that there aren’t legitimate concerns about patient safety and quality of care. Sir Denis Pereira Gray, former President of the Royal College of GPs, has raised concerns that GPs will miss important visual clues that patients are unwell if they don’t see them face-to-face, particularly when it comes to vulnerable and elderly patients. It’s also not clear that the scheme either saves time for GPs or generates cost savings for the NHS overall. The largest study we’ve seen found that ‘telephone triage’ actually increased GP workloads, in contrast to previous research,  since they ended up spending more time on the phone. Patients who were given telephone consultations were more likely to call back or have other contact with the NHS again over the next 28 days, so: “Any reduction in GPs’ workload from reduced numbers of face-to-face contacts was more than compensated for by a substantial increase in the number of telephone contacts undertaken in GP triage.” And since patients were more likely to have further appointments, the study found that the average overall cost to primary care services from ‘telephone triage’ with a GP, ‘telephone triage’ with a nurse, or an initial face-to-face appointment was roughly the same. GP Access has raised concerns about this study. It said that it didn't reflect how GP telephone triage services can be used most effectively, and it published a point-by-point comparison which outlined the differences between its own work and use of GP telephone triage in the study. An independent evaluation of the Prime Minister's GP Access Fund, a government fund to help improve access to GP services, found that:  ""Telephone-based GP consultation models have proved... popular and successful. There is growing evidence to suggest that investment in telephony infrastructure can be cost effective due to the GP time savings that are being achieved."" Another independent study into the use of GP telephone triage is due to report its findings in March. Update 29 November 2016 This article was updated shortly after publication to reflect GP Access' concerns about the ESTEEM study, and to include the independent evaluation of the Prime Minister's GP Access Fund.","We haven’t seen evidence that GPs are asking patients to prove they need to see them over the telephone. Some people do have concerns about whether taking initial consultations over the phone provides the best quality of care, saves GPs time overall, or saves the NHS money.

68,fullfact,"The Conservative government is investing an extra £10 billion in the NHS, more than its leaders asked for.
","“the Conservative party... investing an extra £10 billion in the NHS – more than its leaders asked for” Theresa May, 5 October 2016 This claim shouldn’t be taken at face value.  NHS England said in 2014 that £8 billion was the minimum it needed by 2020 to fill the £30 billion estimated NHS funding gap. That relies on the NHS finding the remaining £22 billion in savings. The government’s commitment of £10 billion, rather than £8 billion, isn’t as generous as it sounds. The £8 billion requested was to cover a five year period. The £10 billion counts funding for an extra year—the last year of the previous parliament—which wasn’t covered by the NHS’s spending options anyway.      The NHS is set to get about £8 billion over the course of this parliament, taking inflation into account. It’s also not all of what the NHS asked for. The NHS said that its ambitions for savings were only possible “provided we take action in prevention, invest in new care models, sustain social care services, and… see...wider system improvements”. The government’s £8 billion commitment refers specifically to the NHS England budget. Outside of this, spending on public health is expected to fall over this parliament, and spending on social care is expected to continue to fall short of what’s needed. That means total health spending in England—including areas such as public health and social care as well as NHS England—will only rise by £4.5 billion over the same period, according to leading healthcare think tanks.   This fact check is part of a roundup of Theresa May's party conference speech. Read the roundup.","The government’s £10 billion commitment isn’t all of what NHS leaders asked for, and isn’t as generous as it sounds.

69,fullfact,"NHS England head Simon Stevens has said the government’s spending commitments are a “clear acceptance of our argument” and that their case for funding has been “heard and actively supported”.
","The latest government line on NHS spending misquotes the chief executive of NHS England. The government has come under increasing fire over its claims about NHS spending: namely that it’s putting an extra £10 billion into the service and that this is more than the NHS itself has asked for. We’ve found problems with both claims and Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England, told MPs only yesterday that: “I think it would be stretching it to say that the NHS has got more than it asked for”. The Times’ Sam Coates commented on Twitter that, in defending itself from this criticism, the government has edited comments by Mr Stevens from 2015. The claim from Downing Street that’s currently circulating states: ""The figures speak for themselves, and they will see an increase in real terms of £10 billion. And at the time the NHS England chief executive said 'the settlement is a clear and highly welcome acceptance of our argument. Our case for the NHS has been heard and actively supported."" Downing Street confirmed to us this is what was said to journalists in a briefing yesterday. But that’s not all of what Mr Stevens said in 2015. Here are his comments at the time, as they were published: “This settlement is a clear and highly welcome acceptance of our argument for frontloaded NHS investment. It will help stabilise current pressures on hospitals, GPs, and mental health services, and kick start the NHS Five Year Forward View’s fundamental redesign of care. “In the context of constraints on overall public spending, our case for the NHS has been heard and actively supported.” Mr Stevens mentions that he was happy that NHS investment was “frontloaded”. That means providing more of the NHS’ funding in the early years of parliament and less money later on, as the government plans to do.","The government is misquoting Mr Stevens. He has welcomed the fact that the money has been ‘frontloaded’ so that more is spent in earlier years and previously said the NHS’s requests are being heard in the context of public spending constraints. He has since commented that it would be a “stretch” to say the NHS is getting all of what it asked for.

","A Facebook post compared the deaths recorded by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) so far in 2020 with the deaths in 2018. Some readers have asked us to look into this as well. The Facebook post says that “UK currently to date including today 22 April has exactly 2,760 ‘LESS’ deaths than the exact same period weeks 1-15 in 2018”. The user said that the data came from the website of the Office for National Statistics (ONS). These numbers refer to deaths in England and Wales, not the whole UK. Also, they were the latest ONS figures available on 22 April, but they only include deaths registered until 10 April. Otherwise, the figures are correct. Looking at just the last two weeks of data, the number of deaths is far above what it was in any of the past five years.   Have many people died in 2020 compared to 2018? The number of people who die varies from year to year. The winter months usually see more deaths, but as it happens – perhaps because of the mild winter this year – 2020 saw relatively few deaths in the months before the Covid-19 outbreak started. There were 138,916 deaths registered in the first 12 weeks of the year. That’s slightly above 2019 and 2016 but quite a bit below 2015, 2017 and 2018. Then the number of deaths registered in week 13 of 2020 rose above the number in any of the five previous years. Deaths continued to increase very sharply in weeks 14 and 15. By the end of week 15, the total for 2020 had already risen above the totals in any of the past five years, except 2018. What about 2018? Even though the total number of deaths registered in the first 15 weeks of this year (184,960) is still a bit lower than it was in 2018 (187,720), that doesn’t mean that 2020 is an ordinary year.

","“Germany sends China £130billion bill for 'coronavirus damages'.” Daily Express, 20 April 2020 An article on the Daily Express website claiming that “Germany” has sent a bill of £130 billion to China for “coronavirus damages” contains several inaccuracies suggesting the German government sent the bill.  As well as referring to Germany sending the bill in the headline, the article subheading says Berlin issued the invoice, the piece uses a photo of Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and it puts her name in the url. The bill was actually mocked up by Germany’s largest newspaper, Bild, which assessed the “damages” to its economy from the virus to total €149 billion (£130 billion). The Express does say in the first paragraph that the bill was drawn up by a “major newspaper”, but the suggestion from the headline, subheading and photograph means that anyone glancing at the piece would assume the German government had sent the bill. Screenshots of the headline have also been shared in isolation on social media. The German Minister of Foreign Affairs Heiko Mass has said the idea of billing China is “illusory”.

72,fullfact,"In June 2017 Conservative MPs voted against a pay rise for nurses.
","We’ve seen a post on Facebook claiming that Conservative MPs voted against giving a pay rise to nurses and claiming that they cheered when winning that vote. This needs some context. In June 2017, after the general election, Conservative and DUP MPs voted against an amendment to a vote on the Queen’s speech, which among other things called on the government to lift the public sector pay cap, which limited pay rises for public sector staff to 1% per year. The amendment would not, by itself, have lifted the public sector pay cap, although it would have increased political pressure on the government to do so. Despite voting against the amendment, the government announced the end of the pay cap later that year, and nurses received a pay rise in cash terms above 1% in the following financial year. Other public sector staff also received pay rises at various levels, though in some cases pay rises were below or at the level of inflation, meaning that they amounted to pay falls or pay freezes in real terms.    The posts refer to a vote on the Queens’ Speech in 2017 after the general election. After a general election, when parliament reassembles, the Queen gives a speech to parliament which outlines what laws and policies the government wants to bring forward. The speech is written by the government.  After the speech, parliament debates its contents and then votes on issuing a ‘humble address’. This address essentially thanks the Queen for her speech. To influence the government’s policy agenda MPs can do a few things. They can vote against delivering the humble address, which is essentially a symbolic vote of no confidence in the government.   They can also place amendments on the address, to try and change the government’s policy agenda. For example, in 2017 the government announced funding for Northern Irish women to have abortions in England, after an amendment from Labour MP Stella Creasy on that issue looked likely to pass.  The vote referred to in these Facebook posts was a vote brought forward by the Labour party to amend the humble address by adding that parliament: “…respectfully regret that the Gracious Speech fails to end cuts to the police and the fire service; commend the response of the emergency services to the recent terrorist attacks and to the Grenfell Tower fire; call on the Government to recruit more police officers and fire-fighters; and further call on the Government to end the public sector pay cap and give the emergency and public services a fair pay rise.” Parliament voted against this amendment by 323 votes to 309. Of the 317 Conservative MPs, 313 voted against and four did not vote. All ten DUP MPs voted against as well. So, it’s worth noting here, that the Conservatives didn’t vote directly against giving nurses a pay rise, as has been suggested by some, but on an amendment which mentioned lifting the cap on pay rises, among other issues. The vote itself wouldn’t have had any direct effect on the pay cap, but had it passed there would have been considerable pressure on the government to end it. And, even though the Conservatives voted against the amendment, the government did go on to lift the pay cap anyway. At the 2017 Autumn budget, five months after the vote in parliament, the government confirmed it was ending the public sector pay cap and in March 2018 it announced a pay rise for most NHS staff equivalent to at least 6.5% in cash terms over three years. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects that prices will rise by around 6.5% over this three-year period, meaning that this lowest pay rise actually represents a pay freeze in real terms.  Pay rises for other public sector employees were announced at different points, and we looked into some of them here. At the time the Conservatives voted against Labour’s amendment to lift the cap, the nurse pay deal for 2017/18 (in other words, until April the following year) had already been set. So nurse salaries were raised by more than 1% in the first financial year after Labour’s amendment, despite the amendment failing.  It’s not certain what would have happened had Labour’s amendment passed. It’s possible, for instance, that it might have resulted in a pay rise coming in sooner or being larger. Correction 22 April 2020  We have added more context about what the pay rises for health workers equated to once inflation was factored in.","In June 2017 Conservative MPs voted against a Queen’s speech amendment calling on them to lift a cap on public sector pay rises, but later that year went on to lift the cap anyway. 

In 2018/19 nurse pay rose by more than the previous cap of 1%, but in some cases will still only have stayed at the same level in real terms.

Overall, 153 of the 238 providers of NHS services were in deficit at the end of June 2016. Two thirds of them were acute trusts. Only 8% of NHS providers were in deficit back in 2009/10, according to the King’s Fund think tank. Since then increasing numbers of trusts have ended each year in deficit. The problem varies by sector though: mental health, specialist and community trusts have been in surplus over the past three years.

","“Three in four labour wards have no consultants overnight. A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends.” Daily Mail, 26 October 2016 “A survey of 165 maternity units found that in 2014/2015 around 27% of labour wards have consultants physically present overnight on weekdays, falling to 15% at the weekend. Telegraph, 26 October 2016 This is correct. Around 27% of maternity units surveyed reported that they had consultants providing weekday overnight care in 2014/15. During the day 98% of units reported that they had consultants physically present. These figures are based on a census of maternity units carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Levels of care at the weekend were lower During the day at the weekend, 57% of units which responded said that they had consultants providing care. Overnight it was 15% of units. The Royal College confirmed that the other 85% of units responded that they had no weekend overnight care. However, the proportion of units reporting that they had consultants working in the unit overnight at the weekend had increased since the previous year. In 2013/14 it was reported that only 7% of units had overnight care at the weekend. These figures aren’t a direct comparison as almost all units (197) responded in 2013/14 compared to 82% (165) in 2014/15. Altogether the 165 maternity units said that they had 2,067 consultants working in them and 67% said the consultants were present for 60 hours a week or more. The Clinical Director of Women’s Services for NHS England told a committee of MPs in 2013 that obstetric units will always have at least one consultant on call at all times even if there is not a consultant physically present in the unit. There is some debate over what impact having consultants on call rather than present has on patient care. Most births take place in these units The vast majority of births in England take place in NHS obstetric units where care is led by consultants. In 2012 it was 87% according to NHS England’s National Maternity Review. However research has suggested only a quarter of women want to give birth in these units. The other options are midwifery units or birthing centres, or giving birth at home. The review also found that the stillbirth and neonatal mortality rate in England fell by 20% in the ten years between 2003 and 2013. But it also acknowledged that “these positive headline indicators, belied variation across the country in terms of the outcomes for women and babies and the quality of the services they receive.”","43% of maternity units don’t have a consultant present during the day at weekends, according to a survey by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

75,fullfact,"NHS hospitals will require all women to show their passports before they receive maternity services.
","“Yesterday, we learned that pregnant women will be forced to hand over their passports at NHS hospitals. No ultrasound without photographic ID—heavily pregnant women sent home on icy roads to get a passport. Are these really the actions of a country where it doesn’t matter where you were born?” Jeremy Corbyn, 12 October 2016 This refers to one hospital in particular rather than to all NHS hospitals, although the government is looking into rolling out identity checks more widely. It was announced on 11 October that all non-emergency maternity patients at St George’s Hospital in London will be asked to provide proof of ID or right to reside in the UK before being treated, as part of a pilot. The hospital said that “Hospitals are required to check patients for their eligibility when accessing non-emergency NHS treatment. We are not doing this effectively enough at present, and are looking at ways in which we can improve this.” It also said that patients without ID will be referred to the “Overseas Patient Team for specialist document screening”. Anyone who is not “ordinarily resident in the UK” can be charged for the use of NHS hospital services in England and Wales, except for emergency services such as A&E. There are one or two exceptions to this, such as refugees and asylum seekers. It has been (roughly) estimated that the NHS spends around £2 billion a year treating patients who aren’t ordinarily resident. EU citizens don’t have to pay. There are arrangements in place by which the UK can charge their home government for the care they receive. Department of Health guidelines say that “all relevant NHS bodies will need to have systems in place to support charging of overseas visitors…[Staff should] identify, without discrimination, all patients who may be liable to charges.” The guidelines suggest that this should be done by interviewing patients to find out whether or not they should be charged. The guidelines also say that “booking-in staff, ward clerks etc. will need to be prepared to ask for basic supporting evidence. Being unable to provide evidence does not mean that someone should be refused treatment, only that they should be referred to the OVM for further investigation.” This seems to be exactly what St George’s Hospital has proposed to do. The government is looking at whether or not patients should be required to bring identification when using non-emergency NHS England services. As with St George’s Hospital, the focus is on finding more effective ways of identifying patients eligible to be charged—which in theory should be happening already. Chris Wormald, the Permanent Secretary for the Department of Health, told a committee of MPs that “for the majority of free healthcare, hospitals do not routinely either check identity or charge, so we are trying to introduce this system”. He also mentioned that some hospitals are trialling a system of asking patients for two forms of identification, their passport and proof of address. The Department of Health told us that ""The NHS is a national—not an international—health service and we are determined to stamp out abuse of the system to ensure it remains free at the point of need in this country. We consulted earlier this year on extending the charging of migrants and visitors using the NHS. We will set out further steps in due course to ensure we deliver on our objective to recover up to £500 million a year by the middle of this Parliament.” Update 22 November 2016 We updated this piece to include information on what the government has said about the future use of identification and charging those eligible across the NHS.   This fact check is part of a roundup of Prime Minister's Questions. Read the roundup.","This refers to one hospital in London rather than all hospitals in England and Wales. It’s in line with NHS guidelines on identifying foreign patients who might be required to pay for their treatment. The government is looking into whether identification checks could be rolled out more widely.

76,fullfact,"£10 billion extra funding for the English NHS will pay for new seven-day services.
","“The money we have given the NHS to fund its own plan for the future - £10 billion more a year by 2020, and £4 billion just this year – covers our promise to ensure that standards of urgent and emergency care are the same across 7 days.” Department of Health, 11 September 2016 The government has said it plans to spend £10 billion a year more on NHS England by 2020. It claims this will pay for new ""seven-day NHS"" services, as well as giving the NHS the money it needs in order to maintain existing services in the face of rising demand, provided it implements its own efficiency savings. Experts doubt this is possible, saying that the NHS will struggle to maintain existing services under current funding plans, let alone expand seven-day services. Seven-day services weren’t factored in when the NHS originally calculated it may need this money. The story starts in 2013, when NHS England said it faced a funding gap of £30 billion by the end of the decade, even if government spending kept up in line with inflation. So it needed that much more, above inflation, to deliver care to a growing and ageing population, assuming it made no efficiency savings itself. It was clear at the time this money was about “continuing with the current model of care”. A year later the NHS laid out plans for how it might handle this gap. One ambitious option was the NHS itself would find £22 billion in savings, leaving the other £8 billion to be filled by the government. The plans did mention a seven-day NHS, but this particular sum of money didn’t factor that in. The Conservatives said in their 2015 election manifesto they would provide that £8 billion in government, and expect the other £22 billion in savings from the NHS. The Nuffield Trust, writing in our election report, said this still left unanswered questions on funding: “£8bn is the bare minimum to maintain existing standards of care for a growing and ageing population … “improving productivity on this scale [£22 billion] would be unprecedented” The new Conservative government followed through on the commitment and started claiming it was giving £10 billion, giving the NHS what it asked for, and more. Actually it's not as generous as it sounds, as the £10 billion counted the last year of the previous parliament, which wasn’t covered by the NHS’s spending options anyway. The NHS was still set to get £8 billion over the course of this parliament. It’s also not all of what the NHS asked for. The NHS said that for the £8 billion to be sufficient, it needs to see “continuing access to social care” and “enhanced effort on prevention and public health”.   The government’s £8 billion commitment refers specifically to the NHS England budget. It excludes areas outside of NHS England, such as public health and social care, where spending is expected to fall overall. That means total health spending in England—including areas such as public health and social care as well as NHS England—will only rise by £4.5 billion over the same period, according to healthcare think tanks the Nuffield Trust, the Health Foundation, and The King’s Fund. The government says that the £10 billion—or £8 billion—will also cover delivering new seven-day NHS services. But the Department of Health confirmed to us that it’s the same pot of money as was suggested in NHS England’s plans to cover its funding gap. Funding expanded seven-day services with this money as well isn’t going to be easy. Early evidence suggests that seven-day NHS services will come at a cost to hospitals, although the NHS says we need to treat these figures with caution as they’re based on estimates from a small number of hospitals. The Nuffield Trust, Health Foundation and King’s Fund all said in response to the government announcement that under these plans the NHS will “struggle to maintain services, let alone invest in new models of care and implement seven day services”. Update 4 October 2016 We added in the paragraphs explaining that the government's £8 billion commitment was not all of what the NHS asked for. ","The government maintains this will happen, but experts doubt it’s possible without more money, as the original plans didn’t factor in the cost of seven-day services. It also needs the NHS to meet ambitious savings targets.

77,fullfact,"NHS England estimates that 30% of A&E visits don’t need to be made.
","“This government are committed to maintaining and delivering that vital four-hour commitment to patients, but since it was announced in 2000, there are nearly 9 million more visits to our A&Es, up to 30% of which NHS England estimates do not need to be made, and the tide is continuing to rise.” Jeremy Hunt, 9 January 2017 It's correct that there have been nine million more A&E visits since 2000/01. But the research finding that up to 30% of emergency cases were of a kind that GPs regularly deal with doesn’t apply to all A&Es. The research is specific to major A&E departments. They deal with about two thirds of all A&E cases.  30% is also the higher end of the estimate. The researchers found it was somewhere between 10% and 30%. The number of yearly visits to A&E departments of all kinds increased by 9 million between 2000/01 and 2015/16. But there are three different types of A&E departments in England. Patients can go to major A&E units, the type you would normally think of when you picture someone going for emergency treatment; speciality units that deal with particular types of emergency, such as dentistry; and walk-in centres that deal with more minor injuries. We don’t have figures as far back as 2000 on these separate types. But we do know that attendances at major A&E departments have gone up by 3 million since 2002/03. Attendances at specialist A&Es have risen by 88,000 since that year.  And visits to walk-in centres, which were recently introduced, have increased by more than 4 million since 2003/04. In 2010 the Primary Care Foundation found that between 10% and 30% of cases turning up in A&E were ones that were regularly seen by GPs. It’s this figure that the Department of Health told us Mr Hunt was referring to when he said 30% of A&E visits don’t need to be made. The report estimated that between 10% and 30% of A&E visits “could  be  classified as  primary  care  cases (types  that  are  regularly  seen  in  general  practice)”. In other words, they’re cases that all GPs would be comfortable with even if they didn’t have any specialism in emergency medicine. One of the report’s authors told us that the estimate referred specifically to major A&E units, rather than the walk-in centres or speciality units which also cater for accidents and emergencies. So it’s not right to say that up to 30% of the extra nine million A&E visits since 2000 could be dealt with by a GP, as this would include the other types of A&E including walk-in centres which are specifically for dealing with more minor ailments. At most, the finding refers to 30% of the extra 3 million visits to major A&E units. Other studies have found that some A&E patients could be dealt with in less urgent settings. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine found that around 15% of patients who attend A&E could be seen by community medical facilities if they were available within 24 hours. In 3% of recorded diagnoses in A&E’s last year “nothing abnormal was detected”. Just over 11% of those whose treatment was recorded were listed as not receiving any treatment. Patients aren’t doctors; it’s not always possible to know whether you need to go to a GP or A&E. Just because someone hasn’t received any treatment or could have been treated by a GP doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t have gone to A&E for help. The Primary Care Foundation’s report noted that the proportion of A&E patients who could be seen by a GP if one was available on the day is “much higher” than those who could be seen outside of A&E if they had to wait several days for a GP to become available. In 2013, the Royal College of Physicians told a committee of MPs that they believed there was a relationship between the availability of GP appointments and the numbers of people going to A&E. The Royal College of General Practitioners told the same committee that they questioned whether GPs had the capacity to take on more work. A study by Imperial College London found that there was a link between whether or not patients could get an appointment with their GP within two days and whether they would go to A&E instead. The authors looked at 95% of GP surgeries in England in 2010/11. But they also pointed out that other smaller studies have not found the same link and that more work needs to be done in the area. Around 85% of people report that they were able to get a GP appointment the last time they tried, according to the NHS’s GP Patient Survey. This has been decreasing since 2012, when it was around 88%.","The Primary Care Foundation estimated in 2010 that between 10% and 30% of cases attending A&E were of a type that could be seen by a GP.

78,fullfact,"The number of GP training places is rising.
","“The government promised to recruit an extra 5,000 GPs by 2020, where are they? … “There are 1,000 less GPs than there were the day she became Prime Minister” Jeremy Corbyn, 20 December 2017 “We are seeing more GPs, we are seeing more training places for our GPs.” Theresa May, 20 December 2017 The number of GPs in England has almost certainly fallen since last year, but it’s difficult to put an exact number on it. Mr Corbyn’s figure of 1,000 fewer GPs uses figures that aren’t comparable, although this also means the actual fall could well be larger than this. Theresa May said during Prime Minister’s Questions that there were more GPs and more training places for GPs. It’s not clear whether she meant to say the first of these – which would be an inaccurate claim – as she appeared to correct herself straight away. Only the claim about training places appears in the parliamentary record. It’s correct that there are more training places available for GPs and more GPs in training filling those places. But we don’t know whether this will be enough to have 5,000 extra doctors in General Practice by 2020, as the government has promised. It’s not actually possible to accurately compare the number of GPs in England over a long period of time. That’s because many of the older figures are known to be inaccurate, and NHS Digital—which publishes the figures—has been making improvements to how GP numbers are recorded in recent years. The published figures on GP numbers in England do show Mr Corbyn’s drop of just over 1,000 GPs between September 2016—shortly after Mrs May entered office—and the latest figures in September 2017. That’s using a full-time-equivalent measure of staffing numbers, which takes into account the hours these staff are working. There are currently an estimated 33,300 GPs working in the English NHS on this measure. Last year, there were 34,500 on the records. But this isn’t quite comparing like-with-like. The main reason for that is because the older figures are known to undercount the number of locum GPs. These are doctors who provide support where and when they’re needed. They usually cover positions temporarily at surgeries, or provide an extra pair of hands during periods of high demand. NHS Digital gets these figures from local GP practices’ records. In early 2017, NHS Digital became aware that GP practices weren’t necessarily recording all of the locum GPs who had worked for them. The result was a sharp increase in the number of recorded locum GPs in March 2017. Taking this into account might mean the recent fall in GP numbers is larger in reality than Mr Corbyn suggested. In addition, if you take locum GPs out of the equation, it’s estimated there are around 1,500 fewer GPs since September 2016. Even the recent figures aren’t perfect. NHS Digital needs to make estimates to account for GP practices it doesn’t get data from. It’s still possible that the number of locum GPs, for example, isn’t being counted as accurately as it could be. It’s also not possible to compare GP numbers now to what they were back in 2010, as there were other changes to the figures since then. Theresa May is broadly correct to say the number of GP training places is rising. So far in 2017, there have been 3,250 GP training places available in England. 3,093—or 95%—of these have been filled through the main recruitment rounds. This is the first year since 2009 to show the number accepted for training via the main routes passing 3,000. The same number of places was available last year, but only about 90% were filled then. Overall, the number of places available for GP trainees has been rising since 2011, but not all are being filled. The number of people accepted for training places faltered notably in 2014, but has been rising since then. The government’s commitment since 2015 has been to increase the number of doctors working in general practice by 5,000 by the end of the decade. It restated that commitment earlier this year. The NHS has been taking measures to try and achieve this. Along with increasing the number of training places, it’s been making recruitment drives and trying to retain more existing staff. But it’s not clear yet whether this will be enough. For a start, the government itself has expressed some concerns that a large number of GPs are retiring. When asked this summer about the recent falls in GP numbers, the Health Secretary said that: “We have had a big increase in the number of medical students choosing to go into general practice, but we have also had an increase in the number of GPs retiring early. That is a problem that we are urgently addressing.” The National Audit Office and health think-tank the King’s Fund have also said it could be difficult to achieve the target given the falling numbers of GPs currently, the shortfall in training places being filled, more people working part-time, and difficulties keeping hold of existing staff. Even with the extra number of GPs currently entering training that the Prime Minister talks about, it’s difficult to say how much they’ll eventually impact the overall GP numbers, when that will happen, and how many existing GPs will leave the profession over the next few years as well. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, told us: “We’re seeing more foundation doctors than ever before enter GP specialty training, which is fantastic, but from that point, it takes a minimum of three years before those doctors can practise independently as a GP. For one reason or another, many GP trainees take longer than three years to attain their Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT). “The number of GPs in training is a positive sign for the future workforce, but it doesn’t really tell us precisely when they will enter the profession, and it also doesn’t take into account the number of GPs leaving our profession, or those entering our profession via different routes, such as through international recruitment.”","This is correct in England, although not all the places are being filled.

79,fullfact,"Over 200,000 nurses have quit the NHS since 2010.
","“Labour reveals over 200,000 nurses have quit the NHS since 2010.” Labour party, 27 March 2018 Research released by the Labour party this week and quoted by a number of media outlets claimed that over 200,000 nurses have quit the NHS since 2010. That’s correct for England, but this figure should also come with a health warning. While the turnover of nurses has increased since 2010, not all of the 200,000 staff “quit” the NHS voluntarily. Some retired (as Labour outlined in their full press release, though did not make as clear in the online version), others were transferred, some were dismissed and others died in service. This doesn’t mean we have 200,000 fewer nurses and health visitors now than in 2010, as new staff have joined the NHS or been retrained as nurses in that time too. In June 2018, there were around 2,700 more nurses and health visitors (full-time equivalent) working for the NHS than in June 2010 (a 1% increase).     Over the eight years Labour looked at, just under 97,000 of the 200,000 nurses and health visitors had ‘voluntary resignation’ recorded as a reason for leaving—the single most common reason for leaving. In the year to June 2011, 50% of nursing staff who had a reason for leaving recorded, voluntarily resigned. By the year ending June 2018, this had increased to 63%. In total, around a third of voluntary resignations between June 2010 and 2018 did not have a specific reason for them recorded. Around a quarter were listed as being due to relocation and around one in five cited ‘work life balance’. Just under one in ten resigned for reasons relating to promotion. Looking at the increase in the number of nurses and health visitors resigning between the year ending June 2010 and 2018, the largest component of the increase were resignations due to relocation and ‘work life balance’. The data counts each individual nurse leaving the NHS (or the headcount), rather than the using the full-time equivalent (FTE) measure commonly used. Rather than just counting every individual person FTE factors in the number of hours they work, for example two nurses working part-time would be counted as one person working full-time hours. Looking at slightly different data on the number of nurses and health visitors leaving the NHS in England (for years ending September rather than June) we can compare this to the number of nurses joining the NHS. These figures use the headcount measure too, rather than looking at the FTE numbers. The data shows the number of leavers fluctuating, in some years keeping pace with the number of nurses joining and in some years exceeding it. The year ending September 2012 saw the largest difference, over 8,000 more nurses and health visitors left than joined the NHS. The number of joiners was larger than the number of leavers in only three of the nine years measured. Unlike those used by Labour, the figures on the number of leavers used here include staff on maternity leave or career breaks. Although more nurses are leaving the NHS in England than joining it, there are still slightly more nurses and health visitors working in the health service than eight years ago. NHS Digital, who produce figures on the NHS workforce in England, told us that this discrepancy was most likely because staff already inside the NHS were being reclassified or retrained as nurses and health visitors, so being counted in the total staff figures, but not in the joiners’ figures. Between June 2010 and June 2018 the total number of nurses and health visitors working in NHS hospitals and community health services in England increased by just over 200. Looking at the FTE figure, it increased over the same time period by around 2,700 (1%). ","This figure covers all nurses and health visitors who have left the NHS in England in the last eight years, including those with an unknown reason for leaving as well as those who have retired or died in service. Overall the number of nurses working in the NHS is slightly higher than in 2010.

80,fullfact,"There has been a rise in deaths from heart disease.
","“Shock rise in heart disease deaths — Experts call for action after rates increase for first time in 50 years” Daily Express, 13 May 2019 On Monday, the British Heart Foundation (BHF) reported that the number of under 75s in the UK dying of heart diseases and strokes had seen the first sustained increase in 50 years. The story was picked up by the Daily Express and almost every other national newspaper. But what was reported didn’t quite match the facts of the report released by the BHF. And regardless, there’s only so much this data tells us. Contrary to what most of the headlines suggest, the overall number of deaths from heart disease in the UK continues to fall, as does the rate (the number of deaths per 100,000 people, adjusted for age). The rate at which deaths have been falling has, however, slowed down significantly in recent years. There are three key things which the Express fails to make clear. Firstly, the headline suggests the total number of deaths from heart disease has increased, and the print article doesn’t clarify until the third   paragraph that the “rise” doesn’t refer to the whole UK population. Looking at people of all ages  the number of deaths from heart disease fell slightly from 152,465 to 152,405 between 2016 and 2017, according to the BHF’s data which they provided to us. The increase in deaths has been among those aged under 75: rising from 42,311 in 2016 to 42,384 in 2017. Similarly neither the Guardian, Independent, i nor BBC made this clear in their headline. Secondly, this isn’t, strictly speaking, the first rise in deaths “in 50 years”. Heart disease deaths among the under 75s have actually been rising since 2014, according to the same BHF data. The BHF calls this the first “sustained” rise in 50 years as the number has increased for three consecutive years.    So 2017 isn’t the first year the number of deaths rose, as suggested in various newspapers, but they probably weren’t helped by unclear wording from the BHF.   Thirdly, and most importantly, the Express said the rate of death has increased, when it hasn’t. Whether you’re looking at under-75s or at all ages the death rate from heart disease has continued to fall (despite the total number of deaths among under 75s) increasing. Over time the population continues to increase in size, so looking at the total number of deaths doesn’t really tell us much (as you would expect this to increase as the population gets larger). What’s more useful to look at is the age-standardised death rate, or the number of people who die from heart disease per 100,000 in the population. This figure is also adjusted to take account of the different ages of these people. For example, there are a lot more people in the UK just under the age of 75 as those born in 1947 (at the beginning of the baby boom) have reached their 70s.   Over the past 50 years the age-standardised death rate from heart disease has declined almost every year, for both the whole population, and the population aged under-75.  In fact for most of that period, the speed at which the death rate fell accelerated. For example, in 1981, the death rate was 10% lower than five years earlier. In 2011, the death rate was 26% lower than five years earlier. But from 2011 we’ve seen that trend slow down. The death rate continues to decrease, but it’s decreasing at a slower rate than it used to.    So although there’s been a slight uptick in the total number of people aged under 75 dying—which is affected by population change among other factors—there has been a “significant slowdown” in how quickly heart disease death rates are improving. ","Incorrect. The number of under 75s in the UK dying from heart disease increased slightly between 2016 and 2017. But the total number of deaths from heart disease decreased.

81,fullfact,"50% of mental health problems are established by age 14 and 75% by age 24.
","“We know that 50% of mental health problems develop before the age of 14 and that 75% develop before the age of 18."" Barbara Keeley MP, 8 March 2018 ""75% of those with a mental health condition start developing it before the age of 18"" MQ: mental health charity “50% of mental health problems are established by age 14 and 75% by age 24.” Mental Health Foundation There are a number of different claims regarding the age at which most people with a mental health condition begin to develop it. These particular claims are based on two different studies, one looking at a group of New Zealanders over the first decades of their lives and the other an American study interviewing people about when they first developed their mental health condition. This is based on a 2003 study by researchers based in Dunedin, New Zealand. It examined around 1,000 people born in the town in 1972 and 1973. The participants’ mental health was assessed in a number of ways—they were given psychiatric interviews at ages 11, 13, 15, 18, 21 and 26, it was determined whether they were accessing mental health treatment already and if they were using “intensive mental health services”. There were five categories of mental health condition identified in the study’s participants: anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance use disorders, conduct disorders and ADHD. The study found that of those participants who had a mental health condition diagnosed by the age of 26, around 230 had been first diagnosed with a mental health condition between the age of 11 and 15 (or 50%) and another 110 (or roughly 24%) were first diagnosed with a condition by age 18. Looking at adults in the group who were diagnosed with anxiety, depression and antisocial personality disorder, the authors found that “adults with these disorders had usually had the same disorder in childhood or adolescence. Our study also provided evidence that most adult disorders were preceded in childhood by a variety of diagnoses”. The authors of the study say that there are “several limitations” with the study that need to be kept in mind when interpreting the results. Firstly the group of people studied were all born in New Zealand in the 1970s and the group was largely white (91%).   They said that while the proportion of people suffering from mental health conditions was similar to other studies carried out in the USA, other studies should be carried out in other parts of the world. So while it is possible that a similar proportion of young people in the UK could experience mental health conditions at similar ages, this study alone can’t show that. The authors also say their findings that 75% of adults with a mental health condition had one before the age of 18 is likely to be an underestimate. Each interview focused on the previous year in each person’s life—but there was more than a year between each interview so some conditions or participants may not have been picked up by the study. The study only looked at mental health conditions that had developed by the age of 26, so it can’t tell us much about conditions that may not develop until later in life. The study’s authors say that “examination of the developmental history of mental disorders in older cohorts is warranted.” And finally, not all mental health conditions were considered by the study. It left out a number of conditions including somatic disorders, sexual disorders, and cognitive impairments. Another study conducted at the University of Michigan between 2001 and 2003 interviewed English-speaking Americans over the age of 18. They were asked questions in order to diagnose whether they had any mental health conditions and also to find out about any possible risk factors they had. The study looked to diagnose a number of types of conditions using similar criteria to the New Zealand study. It looked at anxiety disorders, mood disorders—like depression—conditions linked to impulse control—like ADHD—and conditions linked to substance use and abuse. Participants in the study were also asked questions to determine when their mental health condition began. Although the age at which conditions first appeared in participants varied depending on their mental health condition, when looking at all mental health conditions being examined in the study the researchers found that around 50% of conditions had developed by the time participants were age 14. 75% of conditions had developed by the time participants were 24 years-old. Researchers did say that they thought the results were “conservative”. Firstly this might be because people with mental health conditions may have been less likely to participate in the study. The results may also have been affected by participants not wanting to report “embarrassing behaviours”. The researchers also thought that the age at which participants remembered their mental health conditions starting may have been incorrect in some cases. They also point out that the study didn’t account for the severity of the mental health conditions and whether treatment would be required or available for them. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact","This was the finding of an American study that interviewed people to diagnose mental health conditions and asked them about when their condition began. The study’s authors said the findings were likely to be “conservative” and that some people might not remember when their condition started correctly.

82,fullfact,"The number of hospital beds for people with acute mental health conditions has fallen by 30%.
","“The number of hospital beds for people with acute mental health conditions, where a consultant psychiatrist is on hand to oversee treatment, has fallen by almost 30% since 2009.” “Over the same nine years, the data also show significant falls in the number of mental health nurses working in the NHS – from 46,155 to 39,358 – and in the number of doctors in specialist psychiatry training, from 3,187 in 2009 to 2,588 in the first quarter of this year.” The Observer, 21 July 2018 The number of overnight beds for those suffering with mental health issues, mental health nurses and psychiatrists in training in the NHS in England have all dropped since 2009. Using comparable figures since 2010, the average number of mental illness beds per year has dropped by 22% from 23,400 to 18,300. The 30% drop claim compares years before and after a change in the way the data was collected in 2010, which means fewer bed types are now counted. The figure used in the Observer compares 2009/10 with 2017/18, which are not comparable. NHS England said that since 2013/14, the drop may have been affected by trusts reclassifying beds so they are no longer “consultant-led”, and are instead run by “multidisciplinary teams”. This is for beds under the care of consultants, so won’t cover all beds for people suffering with a mental illness.  The number of hospital beds in general has fallen over the last 30 years, despite rising population and patient numbers, mainly because of advances in medicine. The number of mental illness overnight beds dropped by 62% in the 20 years to 2009. The King’s Fund put this decrease down to the “policy shift to providing care for people with mental health problems and learning disabilities in the community rather than in institutional settings”. The number of full-time equivalent (FTE) mental health and learning disabilities nurses dropped by 16%, or by around 7,500 between September 2009 and September 2017. The figures quoted in the claim compared the number of mental health and learning disability nurses between September 2009 and March 2018, but as the number of nurses working in the NHS in England changes throughout the year this isn’t a fair comparison. The majority of these nurses (90% in March 2018) are mental health nurses, with the rest working with patients with learning disabilities. 10% of these nurses work with people with learning disabilities and difficulties, and are included in the number of mental health nurses because of a wider definition of “mental health nurses” used by NHS Digital, which publishes the figures. Just looking at nurses working in mental health, the number has fallen by 13%, or by 5,200 between September 2009 and September 2017. Following their two foundations years of training after medical school, junior doctors can choose to specialise. There were the equivalent of around 3,200 full-time junior doctors specialising in psychiatry training in September 2009. That number had fallen by around 500, or 15% by September 2017—the most recent comparable figures. There were around 2,600 FTE junior doctors in psychiatry training in March 2018. A report from Health Education England published in 2017 said not enough newly qualified doctors were “choosing/able to train in psychiatry” and that there was a higher proportion of unfilled core psychiatry training posts than in any other speciality. It said that there were “low direct transition rates” from core psychiatry training into more specialised training and that the field relied on non-UK doctors choosing to specialise. It also said the workforce heavily relied on doctors who are neither training nor consultants, for which there isn’t “a secure supply pipeline”. Correction 13 May 2019  We corrected a typo in the section on mental health nurses. It previously said the number of FTE mental health and learning disability nurses had dropped between September 2009 and 2010 - rather than 2017.","These years aren’t comparable due to a change in collection method from 2010.

83,fullfact,"One in four mothers-to-be have mental health issues before they give birth.
","“One in four mothers-to-be have mental health issues BEFORE birth” Mail Online, 4 January 2018 A widely reported study by researchers at King’s College London found that one in four pregnant women (27%) in the study group were diagnosed with a mental health disorder when interviewed. But the study wasn’t designed to be representative of all pregnant women in the UK. Other studies have found that up to one in five women have a mental health disorder during or just after pregnancy. More broadly, around one in five women in England were found to have had a common mental health disorder in the past week, according to a 2014 study. The study aimed to see how effective different types of diagnostic tests were at identifying mental health disorders, and how common mental health disorders were, in a group of pregnant women. The study was based on a sample of nearly 10,000 pregnant women aged 16 or over at “an inner-city maternity service in South-east London”. They were asked questions during their first antenatal appointment about their feelings and mood over the past month and a total of 545 women were selected for a more detailed diagnostic interview. The study found that around 27% of pregnant women were diagnosed by researchers with a mental health disorder after their interview. This included disorders like depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and bipolar disorder. The authors’ of the study told us that while it was designed to be representative of the local south-east London maternity population, it wasn’t meant to be representative of the wider population. The authors also say there were several limitations to the research, including the “relatively low response rate”, the length of time between the first appointment where the women were first questioned and the eventual interview , some missing data—for example where some women declined to answer questions— and the use of only one maternity service in inner-city London. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says that around one in eight women experience depression during pregnancy and about the same proportion experience anxiety. Research by the Centre for Mental Health and the London School of Economics found that up to one in five women were affected by a mental health disorder at some point either during pregnancy or in the first year after having their baby. This was looking at a wide range of studies and the findings differed depending on the type of disorder and the stage in the pregnancy. For example perinatal depression affected between 7% and 15% of women during pregnancy, while anxiety affected around 12% to 15%. Looking at mental health conditions more broadly, a widely cited 2007 survey found that around one in four people in England had experienced some kind of mental health disorder in the previous year. A 2014 study found that around one in six people in England had a common mental health disorder in the week before they were interviewed—looking just at women, this rose to one in five. We’ve written more about the number of people in the wider population who have mental health disorders here.","Around one in four pregnant mothers included in a study by King’s College London had a mental health disorder when interviewed, but the study wasn’t designed to be representative of all pregnant women in the UK.

84,fullfact,"Self-harming by teenage girls has doubled in the last 20 years.
","“Self-harming by teenage girls doubles in 20 years” The Times, 6 August 2018 Not all of that increase reflects a genuine increase in self-harming, because measurement and reporting of the issue is getting better. The number of admissions for girls under the age of 18 because of self-harm increased from around 7,300 in 1997/98 to 13,500 in 2016/17. That’s an 84% increase. That was a decrease on the previous year when there were over 14,600 admissions. Over the same time period the number of girls in England under the age of 18 has increased by just 5%. That’s not quite an exact comparison though. We can’t say how many individual girls were admitted to hospital because of self-harm as the figures count each admission. So if someone was admitted to hospital more than once because of self-harm then the figures would count them twice. These figures can only tell us about incidents of self-harm that result in subsequent hospital treatment, it doesn’t tell us anything about those cases that don’t make it to a hospital. The figures were produced by NHS Digital for the Department for Health and Social Care. The Department says that “the increases shown in the data should also be interpreted in the context of improving data collection and reporting and increasing knowledge, awareness of self-harming and empowerment of people to report self-harm.” ‘Greater awareness’ of self-harm could include medical staff being better at interpreting symptoms, as well as patients knowing there is more help and support available for them, and how to access those services. It adds that improved collection of data on the topic, and the fact that during the period NHS Digital started collecting data on admissions to private hospitals too, could account for some of the increase.  Between 1997/98 and 2016/17 the number hospital admissions for boys under the age of 18 because of self-harm in England has increased by 4% from around 2,200 to around 2,300. Over the same time the number of boys under 18 in the population in England increased by 5%. A wide-ranging study of mental health conditions conducted in 2000, 2007 and 2014 found that the proportion of 16 to 74 year olds living in England who reported in an interview that they had self-harmed increased from around 2.4% to 3.8% and then increased to 6.4%. The study found that “It is likely that this increase in reporting is due (at least in part) to changes in reporting behaviour, that minor self-injury which people had not included as self-harm in previous surveys has started to be labelled as such.” It also said that people may have felt more able to say they self-harmed n more recent surveys as the topic becomes less stigmatised. The increase may also be down to a real increase in the behaviour. It also said “that young people who self-harmed were more likely than older people who did so to report relieving feelings of anger, tension, anxiety or depression as a reason.” The study also found that young women were much more likely to report having self-harmed than young men, but that the variation between men and women reduced as they got older.  The study also found that over a third of people in 2014 reporting that they self-harmed received medical or psychological help afterwards. Women were more likely than men to receive help. The study also found that older people were more likely to receive help. That said, the study’s authors do say that “It should be noted that this relates to self-harming and help received at any point; some younger people may go on to receive support in the future.” The figures from NHS Digital also show the number of hospital admissions for self-poisoning. These have increased more quickly than admissions for self-harm, though smaller numbers are involved. The number of girls under the age of 18 increased more than tenfold between 1997/98 and 2016/17, from around 250 to 2,700. The number of boys increased nearly fivefold from around 150 to 840 over the same time period. ITV have a list of helplines if you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article.","The number of hospital admissions in England for girls under the age of 18 because of self-harm has doubled in that time. We don’t know how much of that is down to improved recording or to an actual increase in self-harm.

85,fullfact,"3.4% of patients waited more than 12 hours in Wales compared with 1.3% in England.
","""The latest annual data on 12-hour waits in A&E show that 3.4% of patients waited more than 12 hours in Wales compared with 1.3% in England. If he wants to talk about meeting targets, he should talk to the Labour Government in Wales."" Theresa May, 14 March 2018 It’s correct that 3.4% of Welsh A&E patients spent more than 12 hours in A&E in 2016/17. That compares to 1.3% for England. Asking who is responsible for that is a complex question. The Labour-run Welsh government is responsible for the day-to-day management of the NHS in Wales, and decides how to allocate the funds it has between the NHS and other public services. But most of the overall amount of funding it has available comes from the Conservative-run UK government, which allocates a grant to Wales according to a formula. Some experts have argued this formula has historically underfunded the Welsh NHS, because it doesn’t reflect the specific needs of people in Wales. More recent figures suggest this may no longer be as significant an issue though. This is not the first time claims have been made about comparative Welsh and English A&E waiting times. In January, the Prime Minister inaccurately reported a much bigger disparity between the two countries, using figures that weren’t comparable. After the UK Statistics Authority stepped in, the Prime Minister issued a clarification to parliament, using the figures we’re checking today. Those new figures are comparable. 3.4% of Welsh A&E patients spent more than 12 hours in A&E in 2016/17. That compares to 1.3% for England. The Welsh government runs the day-to-day management of NHS Wales and determines how much funding different health services get. But the overall budget from which the Welsh government allocates is determined by the block grant it receives from the UK government, which is set by something called the Barnett Formula. The idea behind the Barnett Formula is that, if government funding of the overall services covered by the Formula changes in England, it should increase or decrease by the same proportion per person in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. So if education spending were to be raised by £100 per person by the UK government, Wales’ block grant would increase by £100 per person. The Formula also factors in if some aspects of spending on a service are already devolved. This is known as the comparability percentage, and in the case of health spending Wales’ block grant would increase by 99.4% per person rather than 100%. However, the devolved administrations don’t have to spend their block grant in the same way as the UK government does—an extra £100 per person generated by an increase in UK health spending wouldn’t have to be spent on health in Wales. So UK government spending decisions and the Barnett Formula determine the Welsh government’s overall budget. The Welsh government decides how much of this budget to allocate to health, and can set strategies to try and improve NHS performance. Health spending per person is slightly higher in Wales (£2,233 per person) than in England (£2,169 per person), based on the latest figures for 2016/17. But the Nuffield Trust points out that, rather than just thinking about population share, funding needs will be affected by regional factors like age, public health, poverty, and how rural somewhere is. The English and Scottish NHS each have their own internal formula, which tries to account for these more complex needs (such as age and socioeconomic deprivation) in allocating funding to different regions. In 2013, The University of Stirling applied this formula to overall healthcare spending needs in the UK. It found that the Welsh NHS required a level of funding 9-10% higher than England’s in order to meet its specific healthcare needs. In 2016/17, Welsh healthcare spending per person was 3% higher than England’s. An independent Commission on funding for Wales also argued in 2010 that a needs-based formula should be applied to the funding of Welsh services. At the time it said that the Barnett Formula underfunded overall Welsh public spending by £300 million per year. Yet in late 2016 the economist who led the Commission’s review said Wales was no longer “significantly” underfunded by the Formula.","Correct. That’s the percentage of A&E patients who spent more than 12 hours in A&E, from arrival to departure in 2016/17.

86,fullfact,"The number of elderly people being rushed into A&E from care homes has risen by 62% since the Conservatives took power.
","“The number of elderly people being rushed into A&E from care homes has risen by 62% since the Tories took power.” Jeremy Corbyn, 10 January 2018 Around 28,000 emergency admissions were made to hospitals in England from care homes in 2016/17, compared to around 18,000 in 2010/11 (the first year of the Coalition government). That’s an increase of 62%. This is not exactly the same as saying that 28,000 people were admitted last year though, as the same person may be admitted more than once. The figures also only count people who have finished their hospital care following admission, so there may also be some people who aren’t counted because they’re still in hospital. We haven’t seen figures going back before 2010 so we can’t say anything about the trend in those years. Of the 28,000 admissions from care homes in 2016/17, 90% were for patients aged 60 and over. Those aged 80 and over made up 65% of the total. These proportions haven’t changed much since 2010/11. Overall, 21% of adults accessing long term residential care through their council were aged 18 to 64, in England in 2016/17. There were around 416,000 people estimated to be living in care homes in the UK in 2016. The figures quoted by Mr Corbyn include admissions from care homes run by the NHS and by local authorities, private companies and charities, as well as hospices. The number of emergency admissions from care homes has increased much more quickly over this time than the number of emergency admissions overall. The number of emergency admissions in total has risen by 11% between 2010/11 and 2016/17. Health think tanks Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation say there is “very little comprehensive information available… [and] no full routine national datasets on the well-being or health status of residents” in care homes. Research conducted by the think tanks found there was a lot of variation in the levels of emergency admissions between different geographic areas containing care homes. They added that “In some instances, the level of admissions may be indicative of local systemic problems across institutions.” The research also found that emergency admissions for hip fractures, pneumonia, and mental health problems were more common in the areas with care homes. Looking at all emergency admissions, rather than just those from care homes, the King’s Fund health think tank says they are partly rising as a result of increasing attendances at A&E and a higher proportion of these being admitted to hospital. The National Audit Office also says a number of long-term factors play a role in increasing emergency admissions. One of these factors is that “Between 2001 and 2011, the number of people aged 85 or over in England increased at three and a half times the rate of the rest of the population. Older people are far more likely to have immediate or chronic health problems, more likely to need to go to an A&E department and more likely to be admitted into hospital once in A&E.” The NAO says this only explains part of the picture though. They also point to the introduction of the four-hour waiting standard in 2004, which set a target of 98% of patients being seen within four hours (now reduced to 95%). “This has focused resources, improved the decision-making process and reduced waiting times”, according to the NAO, but it also reduces “the hospital’s ability to keep a patient in the A&E department for monitoring and observation and is likely to be one of the main reasons for the increase in short-stay emergency admissions”. Another factor is shift in the NHS towards more day surgeries leading to more people needing to be readmitted following complications. We've written more about the pressures facing accident and emergency departments here. Update 9 February 2018  We've updated this piece after receiving new data from NHS Digital on the age of emergency admissions patients from care homes.","This is the increase in the number of emergency admissions from care homes in England from 2010/11 to 2016/17. Roughly 90% of these admissions were people aged 60 plus in both 2010/11 and 2016/17.

87,fullfact,"The number of people going to Accident and Emergency is rising every year.
","“The challenge the health service faces is that demand on it is growing all the time. We have an ageing population, more and more people seeking treatment, the number of people going into A&E departments every year is rising up and up and up.” Chris Grayling, 19 October 2017 “The population in the UK is getting older” according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). 18% of people were aged 65 and over and 2% were aged 85 and over in 2016. The proportion of people aged 65 and over rose from 14% in 1976 and by 2046, the ONS predicts that almost 25% of the population will be over 65. In contrast the proportion of young people in the population is falling. People aged 15 and under fell from 25% of the population in 1976 to 19% in 2016. By 2046 the ONS predicts they will make up 18% of the population. 23.4m people went to Accident and Emergency in England between October 2016 and September 2017. This was 32,000 more people than the year before. 15.3 million of these people attended major A&E departments. This was around 12,000 more than the year before. The number of people going to A&E has generally been increasing in recent decades. The UK government is only responsible for the NHS in England. There is separate data for Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Correction 30 October 2017  The piece previously said ""By 2016 the ONS predicts they will make up 18% of the population.""

88,fullfact,"There’s been an increase in the number of EU staff in the NHS since the referendum.
","“And in fact there’s been an increase in the number of EU staff in the NHS since the referendum.” Matt Hancock MP, 31 October 2018 “The number of EU nurses coming to the UK has fallen by a staggering 90% since the Brexit vote… The number of EU nationals leaving the NHS jumped by 14% in 2017… EU nationals have actually fallen as a percentage of those joining the NHS, and that’s on the government’s own figures.” Peter Stefanovic, 11 November 2018 All of the trends picked out in the above claims are broadly correct (even if some of the numbers are not quite right), but none of them tell us very much in isolation. It’s correct that the number of NHS staff working in hospitals and community health services in England who report they are from the rest of the EU has risen in the two years since June 2016. However, this has coincided with a fall in the number of staff whose nationality is unknown: so some of the increase could be down to more staff reporting their nationality. EU nationals made up the same proportion of NHS England staff (whose nationality was known) in June 2018 as they did in June 2016. It’s also correct that smaller numbers of staff from the EU have been joining the NHS since the EU referendum (and make up a smaller percentage of joiners). But we should be careful about saying that this is a consequence of the referendum result. The number of staff joining the NHS varies year on year, so it’s unclear what a “normal” level of EU citizens joining the NHS is. The level could have been abnormally high just before the referendum (so some level of drop-off after was to be expected).   “There’s been an increase in the number of EU staff in the NHS since the referendum.” The number of NHS staff working in hospitals and community health services in England who report that they are from the rest of the EU rose by around 4,400 between June 2016 (when the EU referendum was held) and June 2018. But these figures can’t tell us for certain what the actual increase in the number of staff from the EU is. That’s because there are some staff in the NHS whose nationality we don’t know (around 71,000 in June 2018)—so the data we have is missing around 6% of the workforce at the time. The number of staff whose nationality is unreported also fell by 18,000 between 2016 and 2018. So some of the rise in EU nationals could be down to more staff having their nationality recorded. The House of Commons Library says: “while it is likely that there has been an overall increase in the number of EU NHS staff since 2016, we cannot be sure about the scale of the change”. The information on staff nationality is also self-reported—so this may reflect a person’s country of birth or cultural heritage rather than their country of citizenship. One alternative is to look at the percentage of staff who report they are from the rest of the EU, based on all staff whose nationality is known. Staff from the rest of the EU made up 5.6% of NHS staff (whose nationality is known) working in hospitals and community health services in England in June 2018. That’s pretty much the same as the level in June 2016 (5.5%). “EU nationals have actually fallen as a percentage of those joining the NHS” People reporting they were from the rest of the EU made up 8% of new staff (whose nationality was known) joining the NHS in England in the year to June 2018. That compares to 11% in the year to June 2016. However to put these figures in context, it helps to look at them over a longer period of time. The number of EU nationals joining NHS England rose in the years before the EU referendum and then dropped off in the years after. The number of EU nationals who joined NHS England in 2017/18 was similar to the number 2013/14 and in both years they made up around 8% of all joiners for whom nationality was known. This means we should be careful of linking this sudden drop in EU staff joining the NHS directly to the referendum result. It could be that the number of joiners was exceptionally high in the years just before the referendum—so some level of fall may have been expected, regardless of the result. We don’t know what would have happened to EU staff numbers if there had never been an EU referendum, or if the UK had voted to remain. So we can’t say how much of the reduction, if any of it, is linked to the actual result. “The number of EU nationals leaving the NHS jumped by 14% in 2017” That’s correct, comparing the number who left in 2016 with the number who left in 2017. If you compare the number who left in the year to June 2016 with the year after it’s slightly higher—22%. Looking in the longer term, EU nationals have made up an increasingly large share of those leaving the NHS in each year since 2012/13. “The number of EU nurses coming to the UK has fallen by a staggering 90% since the Brexit vote” This seems to be based on the number of nurses from the European Economic Area (EEA) who came to the UK and registered to work. To work in the UK, nurses need to join the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s (NMC) register. People on this register can be working in the NHS (in any of the four countries in the UK), the independent sector or perhaps not even working in the profession at all. The number of EEA nurses and midwives who joined the NMC register for the first time rose in the years up to 2015/16 (just before the referendum), before falling by 91% from 2015/16 to 2017/18. EEA nurses and midwives made up 5.1% of the register in March 2018—a fall compared to March 2017, but higher than the three years before that. Looking at those who joined the NHS in England, nurses and health visitors from the EU made up 8% of new joiner nurses (for whom nationality was reported) in 2017/18, returning to 2012/13  levels after peaking at 19% in 2015/16. It does seem that nurse numbers have been particularly affected since the referendum. “Nurses and health visitors are the only staff group to record a fall in the number of recorded EU nationals since the EU referendum”, the House of Commons Library points out. Correction 23 November 2018  We amended an error in the claim/conclusion boxes at the top of this article. The third ""claim"" box mistakenly contained the wording of the fourth ""conclusion"".","Around 4,400 more EU nationals worked for the NHS in England in June 2018, compared to June 2016. But some of the increase could be down to more staff reporting their nationality. The proportion of staff who report they are EU nationals is about the same in 2018 as in 2016.

89,fullfact,"We have 100,000 vacancies in our NHS.
","“We have 100,000 vacancies in our NHS yet Theresa May refuses to allow the very best international doctors to come here to care for our sick.” Jonathan Ashworth, 1 May 2018 There were around 100,000 staff vacancies in NHS trusts in England between October and December 2017, according to information from NHS Improvement. It’s based on management information and is not an official statistic, so should be treated with some caution. 90-95% of doctor and nurse vacancies are being filled by temporary staff—so it’s not the case that nobody is doing these jobs. However, there is evidence that temporary staff cost the NHS more, and NHS Employers says that the vacancies are leading to some delays in treatment. Restrictions on the number of “Tier 2” visas granted to people from outside the European Economic Area mean that some international doctors are not able to come to the UK to fill vacancies. NHS Employers says over 400 doctors have been refused a visa since December 2017. There were just over 97,000 vacancies in NHS trusts in England between October and December 2017, according to NHS Improvement (NHSI), which manages NHS trusts in England. That’s around 8% of the workforce. Around 10,000 of these vacancies were for doctors, and 35,000 were for nurses. NHS trusts include all NHS services except GP surgeries—and there were 1.1 million people employed by NHS trusts in England in the same period. This vacancy level is higher than the UK average for all jobs. From October to December 2017, there were 2.7 vacancies for every 100 filled employee jobs—the same level as for January to March 2018. In the NHSI data, there are around 9 vacancies for every 100 filled jobs. These NHSI figures are whole-time equivalent (WTE), so if two half-time jobs were vacant for example, these would only count as one WTE vacancy. This is the first year in which this NHSI data on vacancies has been recorded, and there are still some things we don’t know about how it’s put together. NHSI says that its vacancies data is “based on management information from the sector” so these aren’t official statistics. As we don’t know how this information was collected, it’s hard to know quite how reliable it is. For instance, we don’t know if the data was collected using a standardised data collection system, or if there was room for trusts to interpret “vacancy” in different ways. NHSI told us that they don’t have much information on this. The Nuffield Trust think tank told us that there are lots of different ways a vacancy can be defined. For instance the classification may, or may not, include vacancies filled by temporary staff, or those where the post is not currently being advertised. There are also official statistics on vacancies in the NHS in England, but these only look at the number of job adverts posted, rather than the number of empty jobs. The latest figures on this are for September 2017, when there were around 28,000 advertised full-time equivalent (FTE) vacancies for permanent or fixed-term jobs. Across the three months from July to September 2017 there were around 88,000 vacancies advertised. 81% of these jobs were permanent ones. But as these figures look at the number of adverts, rather than individual vacancies specifically, they can’t be used to say exactly how many empty posts there were in the NHS in England. One advert can be used to fill one vacancy or several, and NHS trusts don’t have to use the system that records these figures. So this isn’t a complete figure for vacancies, only the minimum possible number. According to the NHSI data, 95% of doctor vacancies, and 90-95% of nursing vacancies were being filled by temporary staff. These are either supplied by the NHS Staff Bank, or an agency. So many of these vacancies are actually occupied by temporary staff. Is this a problem in itself? One issue is cost. NHS Improvement notes that, while trusts underspent on agency staff by about £108 million compared to what was planned in October-December 2017, they overspent on bank staff by £664 million. The National Audit Office noted in 2014/15 that “Previous reports suggest that agency doctors routinely earn 50% more than permanent staff, and hospitals might pay up to £3,500 for a doctor to work a single shift.” There is also the question of whether the widespread use of temporary staff affects patient care. The Nuffield Trust, focusing on nurses in particular, says “relatively little” is known about this. NHS Employers says that failing to recruit doctors leads to shortages on rotas, extra costs, delays in treatment, and clinics being cancelled. Despite these vacancies, there are numerous reports that doctors being recruited from abroad have been denied visas by the Home Office. NHS Employers says it has heard that, since December 2017 “at least 400 doctors who we’ve being trying to recruit to come and work within the NHS in England haven’t been able to enter the country and take up posts.” This is happening because of a cap on the number of Tier 2 visas being granted by the government. That’s the type of visa which doctors from countries outside the European Economic Area normally need in order to work here. Around 1,300 Tier 2 visas were granted in March 2018, and around 2,200 in April 2018. In January, the government estimated that a third of Tier 2 visas went to the NHS. Priority is given to visa applicants for jobs where there is considered to be a “shortage” in the UK. Nurses, and some doctor roles, are on the “shortage occupation list”. Because visa applications are oversubscribed, the minimum salary level needed to get a visa for non-shortage occupations is inflated. Without oversubscription it would be £30,000 (in most cases), but in March it was £60,000, and in April it was £50,000. Some, but not all, doctors earn that much. We’ve written more about how salary thresholds are calculated and set here. NHS Employers says that the biggest NHS shortages are among nurses. Because nurses are a shortage occupation, they get Tier 2 visas as a priority—but that means the NHS has “fewer work permits available for doctors” who aren’t in a shortage role. NHS Employers argues that applicants for shortage occupations shouldn’t be included in the cap on Tier 2 visas, which would free up more visas for doctors in non-shortage roles.","NHS Improvement says there were 97,000 vacancies in NHS trusts in England between October-December 2017. It’s based on management information and is not an official statistic, so should be treated with some caution. Many of these “vacancies” are currently filled by temporary staff.

90,fullfact,"We can't attract junior doctors from around the world because they won’t actually earn enough to meet the minimum income requirements.
","“And because of the quite, quite meaningless limits set on what people can earn, we can't attract junior doctors from around the world because they won’t actually earn enough to meet the minimum income requirements”. Maggie Chapman, 25 January 2018 A junior doctor’s basic salary during their first year is below the minimum required to get the relevant visa to work in the UK—unless they’re aged under 26, in which case the minimum salary is lowered. Junior doctors who’ve completed their first year will usually earn more than the minimum requirements. However, in recent months, the amount junior doctors have needed to earn to be eligible for a visa has been unusually high due to a combination of high demand for visas and the government’s cap on skilled immigration from outside the EU. In December 2017 the threshold was effectively £55,000, and it was £50,000 in January this year—more than is typically earned by a junior doctor at any point. Non-EEA students who graduate from a UK medical school, and then extend their visa to study as a junior doctor, are not subject to these visa requirements. The Scottish Green Party pointed us to these guidelines from the BMA, which explain the salary requirement for doctors on a Tier 2 visa. A Tier 2 (General) visa is required for people from outside the European Economic Area who have been offered a skilled job in the UK. Skilled jobs include “medical practitioners”—the category to which junior doctors belong. A junior doctor is someone who has completed their medical degree and is now in further training, which normally takes 3-8 years. Although they cannot practice medicine independently, they make up almost half of NHS doctors, and could give you diagnosis or put you under anaesthetic. As well as meeting the skills criteria, in order to get a Tier 2 (General) visa an applicant must be paid a minimum of £30,000 a year, or the appropriate salary for their job, whichever is higher. The appropriate salary for a junior doctor (as set out by the Home Office) varies according to which year of training they are in. In the first year of training, the appropriate salary is £26,350—but a first-year junior doctor on a Tier 2 visa would have to earn £30,000. From the second year of training onwards, the appropriate salary for a junior doctor is higher than the £30,000 threshold. Similarly, the NHS says that the basic starting salary for a junior doctor in their first Foundation year is £26,614, rising to £30,805 in the second year. A junior doctor starting specialist training (after a two-year Foundation Programme) has a basic starting salary of £36,461, rising to £46,208. So a non-EEA individual applying to start the two-year Foundation Programme would not be expected to earn enough to be granted a Tier 2 visa. However, those aged under 26 are subject to a reduced earnings threshold of £20,800 if they are sponsored for a Tier 2 (General) visa of no more than 3 years. The Foundation Programme told us that a Tier 2 visa would initially be granted to a Junior Doctor for the 2 years of their foundation training, and they would then extend their visa after applying for specialist training. This means junior doctors under 26 would be eligible for the lower income threshold. Even if we assume they pass the earnings threshold, the limited number of Foundation Programme places available puts another limit on non-EEA junior doctors. Health Education England (HEE) told us that historically the Foundation Programme has been oversubscribed, and they said this means Tier 2 visa applicants would fail the resident labour market test. This test asks the recruiting organisation to first assess whether the “settled workforce” can fill vacant posts, before it offers positions to workers from outside the EU. As the Foundation Programme was oversubscribed, those on Tier 2 visas would not have been considered. However, HEE said that there has been undersubscription over the last two years, meaning that applicants requiring Tier 2 visas would have be considered more recently. But it’s unclear whether these applicants would be able to successfully apply, given the ambiguities about the earnings threshold. The £30,000 threshold has also effectively been inflated by quotas on the number of Tier 2 visas set by the Home Office. Each year the Home Office puts a limit on the number of skilled workers who can come to the UK from outside the EU. These workers need to apply for a visa and have a sponsoring employer in the UK lined up. The employers themselves need to apply to the Home Office beforehand for certificates that allow them to sponsor workers who they want to employ. The Home Office limits this kind of immigration by restricting how many certificates it gives out. In 2017/18, this limit was set at 20,700. Some immigrant workers—such as those earning £160,000 or more—aren’t capped in the same way. Each month a limited number of certificates are allocated. If the number of applications is too high for that month, a points system determines who gets the certificates. So if there are a high number of applications in a single month, the number of points you need is likely to be higher too. In December 2017, around 1,500 certificates for visas were granted, and applicants had to score a minimum of 55 points to make the cut—higher than the usual 21. Points are awarded according to the type of job and salary level of an applicant. In terms of job type, most junior doctors will score 20 points unless there is considered a shortage in their specific occupation. This is the score awarded if an applicant’s proposed employer determines that there is no “settled worker” able to fill their role. That means that in December a junior doctor would have needed to score at least 35 points on the salary scale—so they must have been in line to earn at least £55,000. This is higher than a junior doctor salary at any level. In January 2018 the points score needed was 46. This means that most junior doctors would have to be in line to earn at least £50,000 to get a visa. The other way to score points is if a visa applicant’s proposed job is suffering from a shortage of workers—this is worth 135 points, and so will virtually guarantee making the cut in any given month. Some trainees in emergency medicine and psychiatry are currently included on the shortage occupation list, but all other junior doctors are not (even though the Foundation Programme has been undersubscribed in the past two years). Additional visas may be granted in in “compelling” circumstances such as there being an urgent need for an applicant to begin immediately (for instance to perform life-saving surgery). The number of visas granted for this reason was exceptionally high in December 2017, but we don’t know who they were granted to. Thinking beyond just junior doctors, the government estimates that a third of Tier 2 visas go to the NHS. A spokesperson for Cambridge University Hospitals is reportedas saying that “Cambridge University Hospitals, which is proud to have more than 84 nationalities working at the trust, was disappointed to learn that visas for three overseas doctors due to join us in February have been declined because they do not meet a criteria that includes a salary threshold of £55,000.” We don’t know if any of these individuals were junior doctors. Despite all this, 17% of NHS England junior doctors were non-EEA nationals at the end of September 2017. Based on the full-time equivalent figure it’s 18%. That’s a slightly higher level than the for all NHS England doctors, which is 16% based on both headcount and full-time equivalent. How is this the case if they do not earn enough to enter the Foundation Programme? It’s because non-EEA junior doctors who received their medical degree in the UK are not subject to the same immigration criteria. They can apply to extend their existing Tier 4 visa instead, which is not subject to the same earnings thresholds. Non-EEA students who have completed their studies in the UK will already be on a Tier 4 visa, and they can have their leave to remain extended if they successfully obtain a place on the junior doctor Foundation Programme. The Foundation Programme told us that, over the last five years, an average of 520 doctors a year begin the Foundation Programme on a Tier 4 visa. So the majority of non-EEA junior doctors are likely to be on Tier 4 visas, having completed their medical degrees in the UK. The BMA suggests that it is ""very rare"" for non-EEA individuals to be sponsored for Tier 2 Visa for the junior doctor Foundation Programme. Update 12 February 2018  We've updated this piece with more information from the Foundation Programme on how junior doctors apply for visas. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","A first-year junior doctor typically earns £26,500, rising to £31,000 in their second year. To get a visa, most non-EEA junior doctors usually have to be earning £30,000, or £20,800 if they’re under 26. However, at the end of 2017 the threshold was effectively £55,000.

91,fullfact,"There were 8,244 full time equivalent health visitors in the NHS as of December 2017, the lowest number since August 2013.
","“There were 8,244 full time equivalent health visitors working in the NHS as of December 2017, which is the lowest number since August 2013. Numbers peaked at 10,309 in October 2015, meaning there has been a fall of more than 2,065 health visitors or 20% in just over two years”. Labour Party, 19 April 2018 It’s correct there were the equivalent of over 8,200 health visitors working full-time in the NHS in England as of December 2017. It’s also correct that that’s a fall of more than 2,000 health visitors since October 2015. Since NHS workforce numbers tend to vary according to the season, we usually need to compare the same month in each year to see more clearly what the change has been. In this case though the figures are roughly the same when we compare to December 2015. In December 2009 there were just over 8,000 health visitors, and that level remained fairly constant until December 2013, when it started to rise. At around the peak in December 2015, there were about 10,200, meaning numbers have fallen by 19% since then. These numbers are all ‘full-time equivalent’. Full-time equivalent is the number of staff there would be if you added together all their hours to create only full-time jobs. So for example two people working half a week each would add up to one full-time equivalent job.  Health visitors are specially qualified nurses and midwives who work with the community. They mainly work with very young children and their families. They also work with at-risk groups like homeless people, those with addictions and travellers. Responsibility for the commissioning of health visiting services was moved from NHS England to local authorities in 2015. The health think tank King’s Fund has commented on recent dips in the number of nurses and health visitors combined.

They also note more staff leaving as a result of ill-health and for reasons of work-life balance.","Correct, for the NHS in England.

92,fullfact,"A new English language test has been introduced for nurses which means that some people who would otherwise have been able to practice can’t.
","“If you look at the numbers, it would appear that the big change over the last couple of years has been that we've now got European Union nurses going home rather than coming here… It would seem that part of that apparently, I can't quite believe this, was some new language test was introduced which actually did mean that some people who would otherwise have got in couldn’t get in.” Howard Davies, 18 January 2018 The number of nurses and health visitors from the rest of the EU leaving posts in the English NHS outweighed the number joining in the year to September 2017, the first time this had happened in at least the last five years. Almost 2,800 nurses and health visitors, from the rest of the EU, joined the NHS and just under 4,000 left. These are headcount figures and count the number of individuals rather than full-time equivalent figures which would give an indication of the hours these staff worked. These figures don’t tell us anything about why these nurses left the NHS and we can’t say whether or not they left the UK altogether. They also include staff who may only leave temporarily, for instance those on a career break or maternity leave. The information about where a staff member is from is self-reported—meaning that it could refer to their country of birth, their citizenship or their cultural heritage. Although we can’t say anything about the reasons why these particular EU nurses left the NHS, we do know something about the reasons why nurses (of all nationalities) left in the year to June 2017. Around 49% of these nurses resigned voluntarily and of these about half said it was because they were ‘relocating’—although there are no details on where they went. For most of the other 51% of nurses, we don’t even know their reason for leaving. The number of nurses and health visitors reporting UK nationality leaving the NHS in England has outweighed the number of those joining in each year since September 2013. But there have been more nurses and health visitors from the rest of the world joining the NHS than leaving it since September 2015. Since January 2016 all nurses applying to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) from the EU have been required to sit an English language test. In order to practice in the UK a nurse or midwife must be registered with the NMC. Nurses from the EU or European Economic Area (EEA) must have reached a certain score in the required English language tests to register with the NMC, this can be either the International English Language Test System (IELTS) or the Occupational English Test (OET). Alternatively they can register if their nursing qualification was undertaken and examined in English or they have worked for at least one year in a country where English is the first language and were assessed on their English there. These alternative options and the OET test were introduced in November last year. The same English language requirements must also be provided by nurses from outside the EU/EEA when they register with the NMC. Versions of these requirements have been in place since 2005. Health think tank, the King’s Fund, cites the introduction of the new English language test as one possible reason for the sharp reduction in the number of nurses from the EU joining the NMC register, along with the result of the EU referendum in 2016. It says “This fall is not driven solely by the vote itself (new English language requirements were also introduced in 2016 for example), but just as with the Francis report, the timing is hard to ignore.” The Royal College of Nursing has said that evidence suggests “the challenge facing international recruitment in the UK stems in part from a weakening of the overall EEA supply, which is being driven by complex factors including Brexit, worsening conditions for the UK nursing workforce as well as improved economic prospects in the EEA. While IELTS may not be helping this situation, it is unlikely to be the root cause.” Correction 30 January 2018  We corrected this article to clarify that it related to the NHS in England. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","English language tests have been a requirement for nurses from outside of the EU since 2005. In January 2016 these were extended to include nurses from the EU/EEA. It’s been cited as one of a number of reasons, including Brexit, behind falling nursing recruitment.

93,fullfact,"PPE being exported from the UK to other countries could have been used here.
","“Over the last few days it has emerged that British manufacturers have got in touch with many members of the opposition, probably members across the House, saying that they offered to help produce protective equipment but they didn't get a response from the government. “Now I do understand due diligence and that all the offers could not be taken up but some of those who offered to help are now supplying to other countries so they clearly could have supplied in this country and something is going wrong.”  Keir Starmer, 22 April 2020  “He has mentioned offers from British businesses and it is not quite right to say they must have been acceptable for UK standards just because they are supplying different needs in different countries abroad.”  Dominic Raab, 22 April 2020 At PMQs last week, Labour leader Keir Starmer and First Secretary Dominic Raab disagreed over whether personal protective equipment (PPE) being exported from the UK could have been used in the UK. Mr Starmer said that some PPE suppliers who had offered to help the UK government have exported to other countries already “so they clearly could have supplied in this country.” Mr Raab was technically right in saying that the fact that PPE is being exported does not mean it definitely could have been used in the UK, as the UK has different product standards to other countries.  But in practical terms, some of the PPE being exported from the UK definitely could have been used here. What are the regulations around PPE? In normal times, PPE supplies the UK sold for use in the EU definitely could be used here as there is no difference on the regulation of PPE between the EU and the UK. While the UK has already left the EU, during the transition period (which is due to run to the end of 2020) the British Standards Institution (BSI), which sets standards in the UK, is obliged to implement EU standards without modification.  However, a BSI spokesperson told us that while “the regulatory requirements and national standards are the same in UK and EU countries,” they also cautioned that some countries may choose to relax the normal EU standards as an emergency response to the pandemic. For example, Spain temporarily relaxed the requirement for EU regulations to apply to the manufacture of surgical masks, gowns, hand gels and sanitisers. The Dutch authorities told us it had approved the use of face masks that conform to some Chinese and American standards.  This would mean that, while the UK and the EU have the same standards in normal times, at the moment, exports of PPE from the UK to the EU would not necessarily be compliant for UK use. But putting that aside, on the day of PMQs, the Telegraph newspaper’s front page carried a story about the export of face masks to the EU by a firm called Veenak International. A spokesperson for Veenak told us that the PPE shipped back to the EU conformed to European standards, which means that even if those EU countries have relaxed their standards, this kit was compliant with normal EU-standards and so fit for use in the UK. Veenak’s spokesperson told us the company was now mainly supplying into the UK. A government spokesperson told Full Fact: ""We are incredibly grateful thousands of offers of support from suppliers as part of the national effort to ensure that appropriate PPE is reaching the frontline.  ""We are working rapidly to assess these offers, ensuring they meet the safety and quality standards that our NHS and social care workers need, and prioritising offers of larger volumes.""","Not necessarily as British standards might vary from other countries. However, some PPE that has been exported to the EU could have been used here as they met EU regulations, which are the same standards used in the UK.

94,fullfact,"People born poor will die nine years earlier than others.
","""If you're born poor, you will die on average nine years earlier than others."" Theresa May, 13 July 2016 Nine years is the age gap between the life expectancy of men in some of the poorest and wealthiest areas in the UK according to official statistics. The gap is seven years for women. Other studies looking specifically at the impact of deprivation on life expectancy have found similar figures. Life expectancy does vary across the UK Life expectancy for newborn boys in England and Wales was highest in Kensington and Chelsea, at around 83 years. It was lowest in Blackpool at almost 75 years. That’s a difference of almost nine years, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics covering 2012 to 2014. For girls born during the same time, life expectancy is highest in Chiltern in Buckinghamshire, at around 87 years and lowest in Middlesbrough, at just under 80 years. The difference in life expectancies here is almost seven years. In 2014 Kensington and Chelsea, and Buckinghamshire were among the ten areas in the UK with most disposable household income per head. Blackpool is among the twenty areas of the UK with least disposable income, and the South Teesside area containing Middlesbrough is one of the 40 areas with least disposable income. Average life expectancy at birth across England and Wales over this period was 79 for men and 83 for women. Life expectancy is lowest in the North and highest in the South The majority of the top 50 local areas in England and Wales which had the lowest life expectancy for both girls and boys were found in the North East and North West of England and in Wales. The top 50 local areas with the highest life expectancy were almost all in the East Midlands, South East, East of England, South West or London. The link between deprivation and life expectancy A 2015 study by the King’s Fund think tank looked at life expectancy in England from 1999 to 2003 and 2006 to 2010. It found that the majority of areas with persistently low life expectancy during this time also had a high proportion of people earning low or no wages. It also found that the reverse was largely true. Other studies have found similar links. The Marmot Review commissioned by the Secretary of State for Health in 2008 said that average life expectancy was seven years lower in the poorest communities compared to the wealthiest. When this review looked at disability-free life expectancy this gap widened to 17 years. These studies looked specifically at the link between life expectancy and income deprivation, whereas the ONS figures which looked at disposable income. The King’s Fund found that a number of other factors affected life expectancy, including deprivation in old age, housing deprivation, binge drinking, fruit and vegetable consumption and gender.","This is partially correct. Boys born in some of the poorest areas in the UK are expected to live nine years fewer than those in the very richest areas. For girls the figure is seven years.

95,fullfact,"Life expectancy in the UK is falling.
","“Shortchanged: Why British Life Expectancy Is Falling “For the first time in modern history, Britons are living shorter lives, with poor lifestyles, depression and budget cuts the leading causes.” New York Times, 30 August 2019 This (since corrected) headline from the New York Times is incorrect. Overall life expectancy in the UK is not falling, but it is stalling.  Life expectancy in the UK has been rising for well over a century, and in recent years that growth has slowed down considerably and has almost stopped. If you dig beneath those national figures, you can find cases of falling life expectancy in certain local authorities, including in Hartlepool—which the New York Times drew attention to in its piece. The New York Times changed its headline after we contacted them and it now correctly reads that life expectancy has stalled. There are two ways of measuring life expectancy: called “cohort” and “period”. Cohort life expectancy tries to project how long you will live by observing current mortality rates and projecting how those rates will improve over time. It’s regarded as the most realistic number for how long you’re actually expected to live. Current cohort projections suggest a man born in the UK today has a life expectancy of nearly 90 years, while a woman’s life expectancy would be over 94 years. You can find out your own life expectancy in this way using this Office for National Statistics (ONS) calculator. A less tangible but still useful figure is period life expectancy. This just looks at the year you’re born in and assumes that year’s mortality rates apply throughout your life. So it’s a lower number because it’s not taking into account the likelihood that your life expectancy will go up as you get older, because in general we’re getting healthier, medicine is getting more sophisticated, and we’re living longer as a population. But it has the advantage of being a more certain figure (it doesn’t have to guess what the future holds) and it tells us a bit more about what’s happening to people’s health and wellbeing right now. These are the figures featured by the New York Times. On this measure, according to the ONS: “Life expectancy at birth in the UK did not improve in 2015 to 2017 and remained at 79.2 years for males and 82.9 years for females.” If you look at the trend over time in those figures, both male and female life expectancies rose slowly until about 2014, and they haven’t discernibly changed since.  In this section we’ll use “period” life expectancy figures, as these are better for showing us what’s happening to the UK today. Different parts of the UK have seen different trends which don’t follow the national picture. For example, life expectancy at birth fell slightly for both sexes in the most recent figures for Scotland and Wales, and for men in Northern Ireland. As the New York Times focuses on, Hartlepool has also seen falls. Hartlepool has seen the steepest fall in male life expectancy of any local authority in the UK over roughly the last three years. It was 77.6 years around 2012-2014 and was 76.1 years in 2015-2017. For women the drop is much less pronounced: it was 81.6 in 2012-2014 and 81.4 in 2015-2017. Even those figures are for Hartlepool overall, and there’s further evidence that neighbourhoods within the town differ a great deal. According to data from Public Health England, the gap in life expectancy between the most and least deprived areas of the town is 11.7 years for men and 10.2 years for women. In one sense these falls don’t sound very big—but any fall in life expectancy is fairly unprecedented in the wider context of UK trends for over a century, and the stalls or falls in recent years have prompted debate over what’s causing them.","Incorrect. Growth in overall life expectancy has slowed down and almost stopped after over a century of increases. Life expectancies are falling in certain local authorities within the UK.

","“Men in [Boris Johnson’s] constituency live 14 years longer than in mine… Just when is he going to end this scandal, that means that Teesside men have the same life expectancy of those in Ethiopia, and tackle the health inequalities in our area.”  Alex Cunningham MP, 22 January 2020  “His point is absolutely valid, and the discrepancy in life expectancy in this country is a disgrace. But it is coming down and it will come down. Life expectancy overall is at an all-time high.”  Boris Johnson 22 January 2020 During Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, the MP for Stockton North, Alex Cunningham, said that men in Boris Johnson’s constituency “live 14 years longer than in mine”. As a result, he added, “Teesside men have the same life expectancy of those in Ethiopia”. Alex Cunningham’s office told us that this figure came from a BBC report about the large life expectancy gap within Stockton-on-Tees. This mentions Stockton Town Centre, a ward in Mr Cunningham’s constituency where male life expectancy is 64. The BBC article is correct, although the figure has since risen to 65. This is about the same figure that the World Bank recorded for men in Ethiopia in 2017. UK life expectancy figures are not published by constituency, but men in the London borough of Hillingdon, which contains the prime minister’s constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, have a life expectancy of 80.4. That’s about 15 or 16 years higher than the ward in Stockton. Mr Cunningham’s office said they chose 14 as a conservative estimate because the BBC article was slightly dated. It’s worth bearing in mind that these figures don’t mean that men are predicted to live as long as 64 or 80.4 years in these areas, because health and mortality rates are usually expected to improve by the time men born today reach these ages. A life expectancy of 64 is extremely low for the UK, where the latest average for men is 79.3, so it is understandable that Mr Cunningham and the BBC would want to bring Stockton Town Centre to public attention. However, the adult population there makes up less than a tenth of registered voters in Stockton North, so Mr Cunningham is wrong to suggest that their story represents his constituency in general, let alone Teesside as a whole. In fact, men in the borough of Stockton-on-Tees have an average life expectancy of 78.1, just two years less than in Hillingdon and 14 more than in Ethiopia.  In his reply, Boris Johnson called the discrepancy in life expectancy in the UK “a disgrace”. “But it is coming down and it will come down,” he added. It is not clear whether the Prime Minister had in mind the discrepancy in life expectancy between rich and poor, or between the North East and London, but he is wrong in either case. Life expectancy in the North East continues to rise more slowly than it does in London, widening the gap between them all the time. Measuring the life expectancy gap by income is more complicated, but analysis by scientists on the Longevity Science Panel shows that it was widening, at least until 2015, which is the most recent data in the analysis. It is true that UK life expectancy is at an all-time high, but it is now rising much more slowly than it has in the past, and at different rates for different people. We’ve looked at these figures in more detail before.","Men in one very deprived ward of Stockton have an average life expectancy of 64. Most men in Stockton North have a much longer life expectancy, however. The figure for Uxbridge and South Ruislip is for the London borough of Hillingdon as a whole, which is 80.

97,fullfact,"There were 46,850 self-harm incidents in prisons in the year to March 2018, up 16%, and an average of 128 recorded a day.
","“More than 46,850 self-harm incidents were recorded in the year to March 2018, up by 16 per cent on the previous year, with self-harm now recorded on average 128 times a day.” “Violent incidents meanwhile rose to 31,025, up 16 per cent, and of which 9,003 were assaults on staff – a figure that has soared by more than a quarter (26 per cent) in the 12 months to March.” The Independent, 26 July 2018 “The amount of times drugs were found in prisons across England and Wales rose by 23% in one year, Ministry of Justice figures reveal…” “The figures for the year between March 2017 and March 2018 also reveal that 20.4% of drug tests came back as positive.” Sky News, 26 July 2018 Assaults of all types and self-harm incidents are up in prisons, as are positive drug tests, and the number of times drugs have been found. There were just under 83,000 people in prisons in England and Wales at the start of August 2018. The Ministry of Justice aims to randomly drug test 5% or 10% of prisoners in each prison every month. Around 54,400 tests were administered in 2017/18. 11% of the results proved positive for “traditional drugs”, like cannabis, opiates, cocaine and methadone. Positive tests for traditional drugs have risen slightly from 9% in 2016/17. This latest year had the highest proportion of positive results since 2004/5 when 11.8% were positive.  If you include positive results for psychoactive substances, like ‘Spice’, 20% of them were positive. This is the first year the psychoactive test results have been published so we can’t compare that 20% figure over time. The most common positive test result in 2017/18 was for psychoactive substances—60% of positive samples contained them. Second was cannabis, at 28%. Some test results were positive for multiple substances. The random drug tests are mandatory—although a prisoner can refuse to take it and face a disciplinary procedure. Failing the test is a disciplinary offence, which could mean a longer sentence. The number of times drugs have been found in prisons has increased over the last five years. There were 13,100 incidents where drugs were found in prisons in 2017/18, up 23% on the year before when there were around 10,700. That figure’s been increasing since 2012/13 when drugs were found just under 4,300 times. Psychoactive substances were also the type of drug found most often. There were 31,000 assault incidents in prisons and state-run immigration removal centres in the year to March 2018. 22,400 of these were prisoner-on-prisoner assaults and 9,000 were assaults on staff. There were 364 total assaults per thousand prisoners in 2017/18. That’s roughly the same as the number per thousand male prisoners, though for women (who make up about 5% of the prison population) it’s slightly lower. There were 46 per thousand prisoners, of what the Ministry of Justice classes as “serious assaults”. This includes sexual assault, anything that results in being an inpatient at a hospital, concussion and other specific types of injury like broken noses and lost teeth. For prisoner-on-prisoner assaults, there were 262 per thousand, and 106 assaults on staff per thousand prisoners.  The Ministry of Justice changed how assaults were recorded in April 2017. It said this simplified how incidents involving staff are identified but it “is possible this has increased the recording of incidents”. There were 46,900 incidents of self-harm recorded in prisons in England and Wales in 2017/18, up 16% on the year before. Per day, that works out as 128 incidents. This is the highest it’s been over the last ten years, when this data series began. Self-harm is defined as “any act where a prisoner deliberately harms themselves, irrespective of the method, intent or severity of any injury”. The figures may include some but not necessarily all attempts at suicide. There were around 11,900 “self-harming individuals” in prisons overall. Again, looking at incidents per thousand there were 549 incidents of self-harm per thousand prisoners in 2017/18 in prisons overall. Female prisoners have long been more likely to self-harm, and more often than those in male prisoners. There were 467 self-harm incidents per thousand male prisoners in 2017/18. For women, this figures was just over 2,200. There were 308 self-harming women per thousand female prisoners in 2017/18. ","Correct.

","We’ve seen a number of tweets in recent days from journalists, charities and politicians which recommend that people calling the police due to domestic abuse who cannot speak on the phone as they’re in lockdown with their abuser should call 999, dial 55 when someone answers and then hang up. This is similar to claims we’ve come across in the past which said that dialling 55 would allow the police to track your location. Neither of these are correct. Typing 55 on a 999 call from a mobile when prompted is a way to alert the automated system that you need police assistance. You should not hang up as soon as you do this though. If you need to call 999 for any reason the first person you will speak to is a BT operator—they will direct your call to the relevant emergency service.  In some circumstances it may not be possible or safe for you to speak to the operator. Your call should still be transferred to the police by the operator if they hear suspicious noises, and you can also cough, tap the handset or make a noise to alert them.   If the call is silent and done from a mobile phone (not a landline), it will be forwarded to an automated system called “Silent Solution”.  An automated voice asks the caller to press 55 if they need police assistance. You can listen to what happens on one of these calls here. This will also direct the call to a police call handler. The Independent Office for Police Conduct, which ran a campaign about Silent Solution last year, told us that people should not dial 55 then hang up. It said: “The Silent Solution system is used to filter out the many accidental or hoax 999 calls every day. If you press 55, when prompted, you are making it known it is a genuine emergency but you cannot speak. The BT call handler will then transfer you to the police.”  The police will then ask a series of questions to try and get some more details about the situation. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) told us that “Call handlers are highly trained to seek details from callers who may not be in a position to speak and so can use methods like tapping the handset or asking questions requiring only a yes or no answer.” As we’ve said before, dialling 55 doesn’t necessarily allow the police to determine your location. The NPCC also said “Police will not always send officers to silent calls so it is important for callers to try and provide as much information as they can – in any way they can.” Silent Solution is not used on calls from landlines as, according to the NPCC, “it’s less likely that 999 calls are made by accident from landlines”. The Independent Office of Police Conduct says that on calls from landlines: “if there is no request for an emergency, the caller does not answer questions, and only background noise can be heard and BT operators cannot decide whether an emergency service is needed” then they will transfer the call to the police.  The guidance also says that if for any reason you disconnect the call on a landline by hanging up you have 45 seconds to pick it up again and the call will resume. If this happens (you hang up and pick up again within 45 seconds) the BT call handler will also forward the call to the police.","You will only be prompted to press 55 on a silent call from a mobile. And you should not hang up after typing 55. You should try and cough, tap the handset or whisper to communicate on an emergency call if possible.

99,fullfact,"A government review warns it is almost as easy to buy some drugs as it is to buy pizza.
","“Drugs are so widely available they are as easy to buy as pizzas, reveals government review.” The Telegraph, 27 February 2020 “Getting drugs in Britain almost easier than ordering pizza, study warns.” The Daily Star, 27 February 2020 There is not enough evidence to back up the claim that it is as easy to buy some drugs as it is to buy a pizza.   Launching phase one of a Home Office review into drug use at the UK Drugs Summit in Glasgow on 27 February, Dame Carol Black warned of the “abundant supply” of drugs coming into the UK saying: “It’s purer, it’s more available, you can buy whichever drug you want almost anywhere. “It wouldn’t be too far to go to say it’s almost for some drugs as easy as getting your pizza.” Multiple news outlets ran stories based on Dame Carol’s comments , with some  —The Telegraph and The Daily Star—incorrectly attributing them to the review itself, which was published on 28 February. Dame Carol confirmed to Full Fact that she was referring to the comparative delivery times of pizza and drugs, both of which she said can be delivered in around 30 minutes.   After asking for clarification on where this data came from, Full Fact was pointed to a study into crack cocaine use, published in March last year by the Home Office and Public Health England, which interviewed drug treatment workers, service users and police officers. The study said these groups all agreed crack was “more widely available” now than it had been in the past and described the fast delivery as “quicker than a pizza”, although it seems based on anecdotal evidence and made no mention of 30 minutes delivery time. Data on the relative delivery times of cocaine and pizza orders has previously been collected by the Global Drug Survey. The survey most recently collected this data in 2018, when it asked 15,000 cocaine users around the world whether they could get cocaine delivered in under 30 minutes, and whether they could get a pizza delivered in the same time. This sounds similar to the figures provided to us by Dame Carol, but they don’t break down to a UK-only level. The global results revealed 30% could get cocaine in 30 minutes or less, while just 16.5% said the same about pizza. In the UK, 83% of respondents said they could get cocaine on the day it was ordered, with 37% saying it would be delivered in 30 minutes or less. However, the survey did not break down pizza delivery-time by country, so no specific UK comparison can be done. We’ve looked at this before. The 2019 Global Drug Survey found that, internationally, 61.7% of cocaine-using participants had cocaine delivered on the same day and 30% of those reported waiting no more than 30 minutes, but it did not collect data on pizza. The report said: “We also look at speed for delivery and update our work from last year – though we won’t be mentioning pizzas for a while.” Professor Adam Winstock, founder and CEO of the Global Drug Survey, told Full Fact the organisation had decided not to compare to pizza again as there are “other things to focus on that we consider more important than pizza to address our primary mission of reducing drug-related harm—more important than pizza headlines.” No other comparisons between pizza and drug delivery have been done that we’re aware of. Without any updated figures, or specific break-downs about pizza delivery time in the UK, there is not enough evidence to show that it is as easy to get some drugs as it is to get pizza.","There is not enough evidence for this claim, which does not appear in the review itself. The Global Drug Survey compared delivery times of cocaine and pizza internationally in 2018 and found 30% of people could get cocaine in under 30 minutes while only 16.5% of people said they could get a pizza delivered in that time. Figures to make this comparison for the UK aren’t available.

100,fullfact,"Criminals are sent to jail only after committing 55 offences.
","“Criminals sent to jail only after 55 offences” “93: The number of crimes one offender carried out last year before going to jail for the first time” i news (print edition), 20 February 2020 i news has reported on the number of offences previously committed by people in prison in England and Wales. Whilst the numbers are mostly correct, some clarity is needed around the statements made. Notably, these numbers refer to offences, which shouldn’t be conflated with convictions. Several offences may be included in one conviction or caution, although we do not know how many from this data. The headline of the print edition of this article (which differs from the online version) reads “criminals sent to jail only after 55 offences”. This appears to suggest that, on average, criminals in England and Wales commit 55 offences before being sent to jail and that they weren’t imprisoned for any of the previous 54 offences. This is misleading for a number of reasons. The 55 offences figure referred to by i news is roughly the average number of offences previously committed by people imprisoned for up to six months in 2018/19, regardless of the outcome of those previous offences. They may have received a conviction —which could lead to prison sentence—or a caution. The FOI data i news uses in the article shows that women given a prison sentence of up to six months had committed, on average, 60.5 previous offences and men had committed 56.6 offences. For people sentenced for longer periods, the number of previous offences was lower. For example women receiving life imprisonment had committed, on average, 18.1 prior offences. For men it was 19.9. Even just focusing on people given a sentence of up to six months, the data may overstate the prevalence of reoffending, as people may be counted more than once in the figures. For example, someone sent to prison four times over the course of a year (and whom one might expect to have a larger number of previous offences) would be counted four times in the data, compared to someone sent to prison once (who may have committed a smaller number of offences). The print edition of the article also incorrectly reports that an offender carried out 93 crimes in the last year before their first time in prison. It is correct that in 2019, one person was sent to prison for the first time, after having committed 93 previous offences, but we don’t know when those 93 offences took place.","This is misleading. In prison sentences of less than six months, the average number of previous offences was 60 for females and 57 for males. This includes offences that have previously resulted in a prison sentence and the figures may count the same people more than once.

101,fullfact,"There has been a 400% increase in hate crime within the LGBT+ community.
","“We’ve had nearly a 400% increase in hate crime with the LGBT+ community” Dawn Butler MP, 17 February 2020 Speaking on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Dawn Butler, the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, said that hate crimes against members of the LGBT+ community has increased by almost 400%. We’ve contacted Dawn Butler for more information about this claim but it doesn’t seem correct. The number of sexual orientation and transgender hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales increased by 261% between 2011/12 and 2018/19, not by 400%. However, another source of hate crime data, the Crime Survey for England and Wales, estimates that sexual orientation hate crime has actually decreased by 40% over roughly this period. The Crime Survey aims to gauge the total level of crime, whether reported to and recorded by the police, or not. Neither of these measurements is perfect, and so neither gives a full picture of hate crime across England and Wales. Hate crimes recorded by the police The Home Office publishes the number of hate crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales. These figures are published separately by ‘hate crime strand’. Two of these categories are sexual orientation and transgender identity. We are presuming that Dawn Butler was referring to both of these types of hate crime. We don’t know the time period Ms Butler was referring to, but have looked at the largest increase in hate crime records, from 2011/12, when comparable recording started, and the latest data.   The number of recorded sexual orientation hate crimes increased from 4,345 in 2011/12 to 14,491 in 2018/19: a 234% increase. Over the same period the number of recorded transgender hate crimes increased by 645%, from 313 to 2,333. When both types of hate crime are combined, there was a 261% increase in the number of these crimes recorded by the police between 2011/12 and 2018/19. However, there are problems with the measurement of hate crime, which we have written about before. As stated by the Home Office, “increases in hate crime over the last five years have been mainly driven by improvements in crime recording by the police”. The Crime Survey for England and Wales The other source of hate crime statistics is the Crime Survey for England and Wales. This is a face-to-face population survey that collects information on all perceived victimisation, not just that reported to the police. Numbers of incidents are combined over several years to make the results more reliable. The rates of incidents in the survey are then multiplied by population estimates for England and Wales to get a population-level number of crimes. As so few people in the survey report gender identity hate crime, there is no estimate given for this type of crime. However, this is unlikely to have a significant effect on the change in this estimate of LGBT+ hate crimes, as the reported figures are so small. This survey estimated that there were 42,000 incidents of sexual orientation hate crime per year between 2009/10 and 2011/12 decreasing to 30,000 per year between 2015/16 and 2017/18 (using combined-year statistics). This is an estimated 40% decrease over roughly the same period as covered by the police records. As with police records, crime survey data also isn’t perfect. The survey’s data doesn’t include, for example, crimes against children under 16, which is captured in police data.","Incorrect. There are two sources of data on this type of hate crime. One estimates a 261% increase in hate crime on the basis of sexual orientation and transgender identity, and the other estimates a 40% decrease in hate crimes based on sexual orientation since around 2010. Neither measure is perfect.

102,fullfact,"Fewer knife crime offenders are facing jail.
","“There is no evidence in this data that the government’s new approach to tackling knife crime is having a positive effect. The number of offences is rising while fewer offenders are facing jail”. Diane Abbott, 16 January 2020 New figures on sentencing for certain types of knife crime were released this week, prompting the shadow home secretary Diane Abbott to criticise the government, saying that the number of offenders is rising while fewer offenders are going to jail. The number of these offences that are dealt with in the criminal justice system is rising, but it’s probably not correct that fewer offenders are facing jail. In fact it’s highly likely that more are, and a greater proportion of offenders are. Ms Abbott is using figures that don’t show the full extent of prison sentences that offenders will face. Labour put out a press release featuring figures from the Ministry of Justice showing that the actual number of people sentenced to prison fell from 8,050 in the year ending September 2018, to 7,728 in the same period in 2019. These aren’t figures for all crimes that involve a knife—assaults and murders, for example, are counted separately and flagged as involving knives. The figures Labour is reporting cover possessing knives or offensive weapons (other dangerous weapons not including firearms) in public or threatening or endangering people in public. That 7,728 figure is provisional—it doesn’t include offences which happened in that year but haven’t finished going through the justice system. Many will take several months to reach the sentencing stage. The Ministry of Justice estimates this number will eventually reach 8,384 offenders—slightly higher than the 8,050 the previous year. So it’s misleading for Labour to compare the actual number of offenders going to prison in 2018 and 2019, because 2019 figures are incomplete and will end up being higher. Labour should be comparing the 2018 figure with the estimated number for 2019, which will show the truer trend.  As has been reported widely, the comparable estimates indicate that offenders are more likely to face prison, with 38% estimated to do so last year compared to 23% back in 2009. That rate has been growing year-on-year. Sentencing policy on knife crime possession has become stricter over the last decade, with a number of laws, judgements and guidance issued making it more likely that offenders receive prison sentences for longer. It’s also worth noting that the increase in offences may partly reflect a greater use of stop and search powers unearthing knives people are carrying, rather than just more people carrying knives. We don’t seek to comment in this piece on the wider question of whether the government’s policies are having a “positive effect”.","This is very likely to be wrong. It’s actually likely that more offenders are facing jail for offences involving possession or threatening with a knife. This claim is based on provisional figures which don’t include all cases that will result in jail sentences.

Britain has the highest rate of cocaine use among young adults in Europe, their consumption being almost double that of other nations on the continent...  “For every gram of coke they put up their nose, four square kilometres of rainforest are destroyed.” The Times, 30 July 2018.   It’s correct that cocaine use among 16 to 24 years olds in England and Wales is at its highest level for around a decade. In 2017/18 6% said they had used at least once in the previous year. The claim referred to Britain, but used data covering only England & Wales. We’re focusing on England & Wales as data for Scotland and Wales are not available for the most recent year.    Cocaine use fell by about half among young people between 2008/09 and 2012/13 and has since risen again to just shy of the 2008/09 peak. As for class A drugs generally, 8.4% of 16-24 year olds said they had used a class A drug in the past year. The data comes from a survey so there is a margin of error with the results. This survey covers households in England and Wales and so does not cover groups (such as those living in student halls of residence), who have “potentially high proportions of drug use”, meaning the true figure could be higher. Comparing England & Wales to other countries in Europe is difficult because not all countries have up to date data.   The EU collates drug use data from 26 European countries and based on the latest data from each country, England & Wales has the highest cocaine use among 16-24 year olds. Although though some countries’ drug data is old, cocaine use among 16-24 year olds in England and Wales has always been above all the other 25 countries for their latest data year. For example Finland’s latest data is from 2014, when 0.6% of 15–24 year olds had taken cocaine in the past year. In 2014/15 the figure for England & Wales was 4.8%.   However there are other countries in Europe with similar cocaine use to England and Wales. In 2017 4.4% of Danish 15–24 year olds had taken cocaine in the past year. The claim that each gram of cocaine is the result of the destruction of 4 square kilometres of rainforest appears to come from a 2008 statement by the then vice-president of Colombia. He actually said 4 square metres, not kilometres are destroyed for each gram of cocaine. The Times has since corrected their piece.  We’re not sure these figures  are still true, even if they may have been at the time. Colombia produced an estimated 866 tons of pure cocaine in 2016. Using the 4 square metre to gram conversion, that would suggest around 350,000 hectares of rainforest should have been lost in Colombia purely from cocaine production. In fact, in 2016 Colombian newspapers reported that 180,000 hectares of rainforest were lost that year (according to official statistics). So around half the area as would be expected from the “4 square metre per gram” claim, and that assumes that cocaine consumed in the UK is of 100% purity and that all Colombian deforestation is due to cocaine production.   Correction 2 August 2018  We have clarified that the claim about cocaine-related rainforest destruction was out by a factor of a million, not a thousand.  We have added the fact that the Times have now amended their piece with the correct figure of 4 square metres per gram. ","Cocaine use is at a nine-year high among 16-24 year olds in England & Wales. 6% had taken cocaine in the past year.

104,fullfact,"More than 30,000 children aged between 10 and 15 now say that they are in gangs.
","“More than 30,000 children aged between 10 and 15 now say that they are in gangs, according to research that will fuel concerns about the country’s violent crime epidemic.” The Times, 25 June 2018 The 30,000 estimate has significant limitations, and cannot be fairly used to draw a link to a supposed rising crime epidemic. The figure of 30,000 children comes from the Office of the Children’s Commissioner. It produced this estimate in a 2017 study, using data from 2013/14 from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which reported that 0.9% of 10-15 year olds it surveyed in England and Wales described themselves as being in a street gang. But this figure is subject to significant uncertainty, as The Office of the Children’s Commissioner noted at the time. The survey didn’t include children who are detained, “missing”, or living in health and care residential establishments, and the definition of a street gang is quite broad. The figure of 30,000 could vary a lot if there’s just a small amount of error in the survey’s findings. The 0.9% figure equates to about 26 young people (in a survey of 3,000) reporting themselves as being in a gang. In a repeat survey for 2016/17, it found 0.7% did so, but that’s the equivalent of about five fewer young people. Ultimately, the sample size, infrequency and wider data recording issues mean we can’t confidently say exactly how many children are in gangs, and whether this number has gone up or down in recent years. While this is the best available data we have on gangs, it cannot be taken as evidence that young people are fuelling a “violent crime epidemic”. This article does not assess whether or not there is such an “epidemic”. 0.9% of 10-15 year olds in England in Wales reported that they were a member of a street gang, according to ONS data for 2013/14, sourced to the Crime Survey for England and Wales. This is the data which the Times report says the office of the Children’s Commissioner used. In 2017, the Office of the Children’s Commissioner used the 0.9% figure to estimate that around 30,000 10-15 year olds were in street gangs in England, based on population figures for England (mid-2015). It also assumes that gang-membership levels are the same in both England and Wales. The ONS published more recent data in May this year (which wouldn’t have been available to the Children’s Commissioner when their report was published). It finds that 0.7% of 10-15 year olds in England and Wales reported being in a gang in 2016/17. It also reports that 0.2% of 16 to 24 year olds are a member of a street gang, compared to 0.7% in the 2013/14 data. The sample sizes of the research mean it’s hard to precisely estimate the number of children in gangs, or change over time. Applying the reported percentage of 10-15 year olds in gangs to population statistics suggests that the number in England has fallen by 7,000 from 2013/14 to 2016/17. Yet this is the equivalent to about five fewer people (in a survey of around 3,000) reporting that they are in a gang in the 2016/17 survey. Given what we also know about young children responding inaccurately, or giving “funny” answers, in surveys, this data isn’t good enough to give a very precise sense of change over time. Street gangs are also not necessarily committing criminal activities, according to the ONS definition. It told us its survey defined a street gang as:  “groups of young people who hang around together and The 30,000 figure formed part of a report on vulnerable children, in which the Children’s Commissioner recognised that the data available to it on street gangs was limited and “should be treated with caution”. It added: “The information for people involved in gangs or have been victims of gangs is very limited and our research revealed an important gap in the data.” It also highlighted that the ONS data doesn’t cover “people living in health and care residential establishments as well as people detained are not included in these estimates. Children included in the missing population may face an increased risk to be involved in gangs and thus the estimates may underreport the real numbers.” The Office of the Children’s Commissioner told us that: “We don’t collect data but collate it from many sources and sometimes the starting point for an estimate may be, in our own view, statistically dated, or weak but nonetheless, within certain standards, the best available at the time. Where that is the case we do what we think we can, transparently, to model towards a reasonable estimate of what the number is at the time of publishing.” The lack of consistently published data and limitations in recording practices mean it’s hard to get a perfect picture around the number of young people in gangs. It certainly seems a stretch to use the existing data as evidence of a phenomenon which is fuelling a supposed “violent crime epidemic”, given the limitations we highlight above. The Office of the Children’s Commissioner told us that: “Ever since the Office of the Children’s Commissioner undertook to assess the levels of vulnerable children in England in 2016, with a view to publishing findings in 2017, there has been a dual purpose. “Firstly to fill an existing statistical gap and find the best possible and reliable estimates we could for numbers that previously have not been calculated, and to beg the question “why hadn’t they been?” … “Secondly to highlight how hard it can be to arrive at those numbers when data collection can be patchy, sometimes non-existent, subject to local variation, variations of interpretation of official terms (not least the word ‘vulnerable’) and in what form the data came.” They also said that: “In looking to next year part of our call on Government and local authorities and other services will be to provide our calculations on Vulnerable Children with data that is fresher, more robust and comprehensive on the area of gang membership.”","We don’t know the exact number, and it’s difficult to get an accurate measure of this. In 2013/14, a survey found 0.9% of 10-15 year olds in England and Wales said they were in a street gang, which implies around 30,000 children in England, but this should not be taken as exact.

105,fullfact,"The robbery rate shot up by 10% in a year - more than any of 12 other nations examined by the Home Office
","“New Home Office analysis shows the UK is a world leader in... robberies.” Louise Haigh MP, 9 May 2018 “Government figures show the robbery rate shot up by 10% in a year—more [than] any of 12 other nations examined by the Home Office.” Daily Mirror, 9 May 2018 It’s correct that the number of recorded robberies in England and Wales increased by 10% from 2015 to 2016, and when factoring in population changes, the robbery rate per 100,000 people increased by 9%. Both of those increases are greater than in 12 other countries analysed by the Home Office.  Not all crimes are reported to, and recorded by the police, so these figures can only tell us so much about the true level of crime.  The UK doesn’t have more robberies, or robberies per person, than the rest of the world. The analysis by the Home Office looked at figures for England and Wales rather than the UK as crime figures are published separately for Scotland and Northern Ireland. England and Wales’s recorded reported robbery rate in 2016 was fourth highest of the countries included in the analysis, while Scotland’s robbery rate was the lowest. It’s difficult to make an exact comparison between the robbery figures in each country due to the different definitions of robbery and the way the figures are recorded in each country. Robbery is stealing or attempting to steal from a person or business using force or the threat of force. In 2015 there were around 51,000 robberies recorded by police in England and Wales, which increased to about 56,000 in 2016 (or by 10%). That’s 96 robberies per 100,000 people, a 9% increase on 2015, once you factor in the changes in population from 2015 to 2016. Since the Home Office analysis was published, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published data for 2017, showing that the number of robberies increased to about 74,000 (or by 33%) from 2016 to 2017. The ONS says that improvements in police recording may have had some impact on the rising numbers, but an actual increase in robberies may also have happened. Not all robberies are reported to the police so we can also use survey results to determine how many robberies may have happened in total in any given year. There were estimated to be 175,000 robberies (against people, these figures don’t include businesses) in 2017, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales. But because the figures are based on a survey and relatively few respondents may have experienced a robbery it’s hard to be precise. The ONS told us the figure could have been anywhere between 125,000 and 224,000 Not all countries have similar surveys measuring crimes, whether or not they’re reported, so we’ve not compared these figures with the countries in the Home Office analysis.   The Home Office analysis showed that between 2015 and 2016 the number of robberies in England and Wales increased more than in any of the other 12 countries examined. That doesn’t mean that the actual number of robberies was higher, even if you account for the different population sizes in each country. In 2016 the robbery rate in England and Wales was 96 per 100,000 people—lower than the USA, Spain and France, but above the other countries examined.   Despite increasing by a third in 2017 to 127 per 100,000, the robbery rate is still lower than the rate in France, but is now higher than the USA (some of the 12 countries in the original analysis haven’t released figures for 2017 yet so we can’t make a full comparison). Because each country records crime data in different ways, comparing data between countries should be taken with a pinch of salt. Recorded crime doesn’t capture the total level of crime as it doesn’t include crime that isn’t reported to the police. We don’t know how high the levels of reporting and recording are in each country. This could mean that that while some countries can have similar recorded robbery figures, the number of robberies that actually happen may be very different. Also police forces record crime differently in different countries. Most countries in Europe record crimes when they are initially reported to the police (input statistics). But in Germany and Spain crime is recorded when the investigation is over (output statistics) which Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office, say tends to be lower than input statistics.    And there are slightly different definitions of robbery in each country that affect comparability. For example, some countries exclude forms of bag-snatching, which are included in the robbery statistics for other European countries.","Broadly correct. The number of recorded robberies in England and Wales increased by 10% and the robbery rate by 9% between 2015 and 2016. That’s more than in any of the other 12 countries examined by Home Office analysis.

106,fullfact,"More people are being caught carrying blades.
","“On the law enforcement side we’re catching more people carrying a blade, more are being prosecuted than ever before, and they spend longer in prison.” Dominic Raab MP, 17 May 2018 Between 2016 and 2017, there was a 33% increase in the number of offences relating to possession of an article with a blade or point recorded by police in England and Wales. There were over 17,000 offences involving possession of an article with a blade or point in 2017. The number of recorded offences involving possession of a knife in England and Wales has increased in recent years, though some of this rise could be down to improved police recording and “targeted police action in relation to knife crime”. Before then, recorded knife possession offences were on a downward trend since specifically recording possession of knives was introduced in 2009. Recorded knife crime generally has also been increasing and you can read more about that in our knife crime supercheck. There was a 12% increase in prosecutions for possession of an article with blade or point offences in England and Wales between 2016 and 2017, to just under 9,000. That includes prosecutions against children. The figures are for those prosecutions where possession of a knife was the defendant’s most serious offence if multiple offences are being tried.  There was a 9% rise in the number of knife and offensive weapon offences—specifically those relating to possession and aggravated possession—that led to a caution or a conviction in England and Wales between 2016 and 2017. The average custodial sentence for a knife or offensive weapon possession offence in England and Wales rose by 2.2 months between 2008 and 2017, to 7.5 months. 38% of offenders were sentenced to more than six months, compared to 20% in 2008. In 2015, a new minimum sentence of six months was introduced for adults convicted of possessing a knife or offensive weapon for the second time or more. Convictions are now more likely to result in a custodial sentence. In 2017, 63% of convictions of a knife or offensive weapon offence result in immediate custody or a suspended sentence, compared to 42% in 2008.

107,fullfact,"More people have died this year through stabbings or shooting, and more young men.
","“Sadly an awful lot more people have died this year through stabbings or shooting, and more young men.” Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, 17 May 2018 It’s unclear if this is referring to deaths in London or across the whole of England and Wales. The closest data we have to this is for homicides involving stabbings in London until the end of last year and those stabbings or shootings across the whole of England and Wales in 2016/17. These show increases over the last few years. We’ve asked Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe for more information. We contacted the Metropolitan Police who told us that it didn’t generally give out an up-to-date running total on the number of homicides as these figures are published annually. Separate figures on the number of homicides involving sharp instruments suggests that the numbers have stayed relatively flat since 2013/14 but increased in the first nine months of 2017/18 (the most recent figures available). We haven’t found similar figures for shootings. Earlier this year the Metropolitan Police had told us there had been 38 fatal stabbings up until 20 April. Looking at the whole of England and Wales the number of homicides involving a sharp instrument had generally been decreasing over the past decade, but the number has increased in the past two years to 215 in 2016/17 (the most recent figures available), up from 212 in 2015/16. Similarly the number of homicides involving a shooting had generally decreased to a low of 21 in 2014/15, but has increased for the last two years, to 32 in 2016/17.  Around three-quarters of victims of homicides involving a sharp instrument in 2016/17 were male—and the majority of those were under the age of 34. The proportion who were male has increased in recent years, but is just below the level it was in 2007/08 (the highest recorded in the last decade).  Over half of all victims of firearms offences in 2015/16 were between the ages of 15 and 34—not including air weapons and including all offences, not just homicides. Figures on the gender and age of the homicide victims who die in shootings aren’t regularly published. Increases in knife and gun crimes recorded by the police are partly down to improvements in recording practices, but the Office for National Statistics also put this down to a genuine rise.

108,fullfact,"8% of stop and searches are knife crime related
","“Only 8% of stop and searches are knife crime related, the overwhelming majority are drug-related.” Iain Dale, 19 April 2018 This claim is actually just referring to London. In the first three months of 2018, about 9% of stop and searches resulting in a “positive outcome” were for “weapons, points and blades. That’s according to Metropolitan Police figures (which excludes the City of London). A positive outcome is where action is taken against people who’ve been stopped and searched, like arrests or warnings. The Met Police told us that “weapons, points and blades” included all offensive weapons except firearms, but including things like acid.   By comparison, 60% of stop and searches with a positive outcome were drug-related. We don’t have the same figures for England and Wales, but we do know that around 14% of searches that result in arrest involve offensive weapons, not including firearms. Just over half are for drugs. Given that these figures are only for arrests, we might expect weapons to account for a greater proportion of cases than in the London figures. But if you want to find out how effective stop and search is at rooting out weapons, it’s more useful to compare the total number of searches for weapons and the number of positive outcomes. In the first three months of this year, there were 5577 searches for weapons, points and blades, and 887 positive outcomes, which will include searches for other things (e.g. drugs) that happen to unearth a weapon. The latest data for England and Wales covers from April 2016 to March 2017 when there were nearly 33,000 searches for offensive weapons, and about 7,000 arrests (arrests being only one of the positive outcomes). These arrests may also come about from searches for other things.   The England and Wales figures relate to stop and searches made under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 which makes up 99.8% of all stop and searches.

109,fullfact,"Stop and search is achieving a higher arrest rate.
","“And what we have seen in the way stop and search is now being used, is it is achieving a higher arrest rate.” Elizabeth Truss MP, 19 April 2018 17% of stop and searches in England and Wales resulted in arrests in 2016/17, compared to 8% in 2009/10. There were over 300,000 stop and searches in 2016/17, compared to 1.4 million in 2009/10—meaning the overall number of stop and searches fell by 78%. While it's tempting to take the higher arrest rate as an indicator of success, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) note that an arrest isn't necessarily a success, nor is a failure to uncover any wrongdoing necessarily a failure. Offenders could, for instance, be arrested even if they're found to be empty of stolen or prohibited goods because they might react violently to officers or be wanted for another offence. On the flipside, failing to uncover wrongdoing could be regarded as a success if, without the stop and search powers in place, the person under suspicion would otherwise have been arrested unnecessarily. HMICFRS also reports that “While stop and searches on white people have decreased by 78 percent, stop and searches on people from BAME communities decreased by 69 percent. The decrease for black people was even lower, at 66 percent.” This is based on stop and searches under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which make up the vast majority of stop and searches. People who self-define as black or black British are the most likely to be stop and searched of any ethnic group—it’s estimated at around 29 per 1,000 in 2016/17. They’re over eight times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, and that ratio has been rising in recent years. HMICFRS said in December 2017 that the rising ethnic disparity in stop and search frequency “has the potential to erode public trust and confidence in the police, particularly amongst black people, despite the reductions in the use of stop and search powers”. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Correct. The arrest rate in England and Wales rose from 8% in 2009/10 to 17% in 2016/17.

110,fullfact,"Before recent reforms, fewer than one in 10 stops and searches led to an arrest. Now the rate is the highest on record.
","“In London, about one in three stops and searches results in some positive thing being found… something that you shouldn't have... that is quite a high proportion, frankly. “Our outcome rate—one in three positive—is the same, whether you're black or white or whoever you are.” Cressida Dick, 8 August 2017 “…before the reforms took effect, of more than one million stops taking place each year, fewer than one in ten ever led to an arrest… Since the reforms, the number of stop and searches has come down by almost two thirds while latest figures show that the stop-to-arrest rate is now the highest on record.” Amber Rudd, 9 August 2017 It’s correct that the use of stops and searches has fallen both in London and across England and Wales, following policy changes a few years ago. Officers do find something in about a third of cases in London, that’s more than the average for the whole of England and Wales. Black people remain much more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, and this gap has widened in the most recent year we have figures for. Almost all stops and searches take place under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and laws associated with that. It’s used by police to search people for things like drugs, weapons and stolen property, provided the officer has a reasonable cause to suspect they will find something. The use of section 1 searches has been declining rapidly in the last few years. Stops and searches can take place under different laws as well, but those have also been falling rapidly and have now fallen largely out of use. This is due to changes in policy since 2012 to increase ‘fair use’ of the powers by the Home Office and Metropolitan Police. The government also started a new scheme in 2014 called ‘Best use of stop and search’ which aimed to increase transparency around how stops and searches happened and to make forces more effective at identifying appropriate cases for using the powers. These changes have led to sharp falls in the use of stop and search both in London and throughout England and Wales. The use of stop and search in England and Wales peaked in 2008/09 when over 1.5 million were carried out. It has declined in every year since then. Since 2011/12—just before the police changes were brought in—stops and searches have fallen by two-thirds, as Amber Rudd correctly says. The latest figures put them at under 400,000 in 2015/16.  London has seen the same pattern. Stops and searches peaked in 2008/09 at nearly 600,000 and have fallen since to just under 160,000. Stop and searches are still much more common in London, once you factor in the resident population. This doesn’t take into account of the fact that a lot of people come to London from outside on a daily basis as well and could be stopped and searched but not counted in the population figures. Amber Rudd is correct about the increased arrest rate from stops and searches. Only 9% of stops and searches resulted in an arrest at the peak of its use between 2008 and 2011. That proportion has increased in the years since and was 16% by 2015/16. Arrests are more likely in London—with 19% of searches resulting in arrest in the same year. The most recent figures to June this year show the rate now at 20%. That’s according to figures gathered over the last year by the Metropolitan Police, and matches Cressida Dick’s claim. These are called “positive outcome” searches—which refers to any case where action is taken against people who’ve been stopped and searched. This includes arrest cases but also covers other resolutions like warnings and Penalty Notices. All cases where there isn’t a positive outcome are called ‘No Further Actions’. As Cressida Dick also says, the outcome rates are similar whatever people’s ethnicity is. White people are slightly more likely to have something found on them than black or Asian people, but the rate is roughly a third for all three groups. Across the rest of England and Wales, about a quarter of stops and searches had a positive outcome in 2015/16. This figure could be higher in reality because some No Further Action cases do involve detentions under the Mental Health Act or informal advice being given when an officer has found something untoward. At least, that’s what the latest ‘experimental figures’—i.e. to be interpreted with caution—show. These cover figures from just under half of police forces in England and Wales, not including the Metropolitan Police in London. They also find that whether someone is white or not makes little difference—the rate is still about 20%. Again, these cover ‘positive outcomes’ of stops and searches, but they’re different to the figures mentioned in the previous section because they only include cases where the officer found what they were searching for in the first place. The majority of the population is white and the majority of stops and searches involve white people. Per person, black people are more likely to be stopped and searched. Black people are about six times as likely to be stopped and searched as white people. Five in every 1,000 white people was stopped and searched in 2015/16, compared to 31 in every 1,000 black people.  The difference in rates between white and black people has grown since last year. Stops and searches have fallen in the last year overall but those involving white people have fallen faster than those involving black people. Black people are most likely to be arrested following a stop and search. 22% of stops and searches on black people resulted in an arrest in 2015/16, compared to 14% of those conducted on white people. We have more figures just for the Metropolitan Police in London covering the 11 months from August 2016 to June 2017. Black people seem more likely to be stopped in London than elsewhere in the country in recent years. White people are also more likely to be stopped in the capital.

111,fullfact,"Migration is linked to 82% of population growth (between 2001 and 2016).
","“Migration linked to 82% of growth in the population” The Times, 23 August 2018 Population growth is driven by two things—net migration, and “natural change” (the difference between the number of births and deaths). From 2001 to 2016, migration accounted for 58% of this change in the UK. However, the think tank Migration Watch has asked what percentage of natural change is itself caused by migration—i.e. how much population change is driven by births to immigrant parents. It estimates that, from 2001 to 2016, 82% of population change was “linked” to migration—meaning it was driven either by net migration (roughly 50% of the overall change, once accounting for deaths of immigrants), or births to immigrant parents (roughly 35%, after accounting for deaths of people with immigrant parents). So it’s important to bear in mind these headlines aren’t just talking about the direct impact of net migration—they’re factoring in an estimate of the indirect impact of children of immigrant parents. This calculation is broadly accurate, and fits with wider demographic trends—net migration picked up significantly in the late 1990s, as did the number of children born to immigrant parents. However, the calculations rest on some uncertain assumptions —for instance, recordings of deaths don’t state whether someone is the child of an immigrant, so the deaths of people with immigrant parents has to be estimated using other data. There have also been recently highlighted issues with the accuracy of net migration data. This means that we should not treat the 82% figure as exact, but rather broadly accurate, and indicative of wider demographic patterns. The combined effect of net migration and natural change is used to estimate population increase each year. “Net migration” tells us the difference between how many people move in and out of the country (for at least 12 months) each year. This includes both foreign nationals and British citizens who immigrate or emigrate. “Natural change” is the difference between the number of births and deaths among the population each year. Analysis of Office for National Statistics (ONS) data by the Migration Observatory at Oxford University shows that, since the early 1990s, net migration has become an increasing driver of population change. It was a bigger driver than natural change in every year from mid-1998 onwards, except the years to mid-2012 and -2013. The rate of natural change has also picked up notably since the mid-2000s. Between mid-1991 and mid-2016, net migration accounted for 55% of total population growth in the UK—an additional 4.5 million people. In the year to mid-2017, it accounted for almost 60%, based on ONS data. Migration Watch, which produced the 82% figure, is looking at population change in a slightly different way. It also wants to know how much “natural change” is itself a result of migration—i.e. how many births in the UK are to immigrant parents. Migration Watch estimates that the twin impact of migration, and children born to immigrants, contributed 82% of the net population increase of 6.6 million between 2001 and 2016. Of that, it estimates that net migration contributed 3.1 million people (after accounting for deaths of immigrants in that period)—just under 50% of the increase. It estimates that “natural change” in terms of children born to immigrants added an additional net 2.3 million people to the population. This involves a number of calculations, some of which are fairly complex, and the overall picture seems correct. The net migration data is taken from the ONS. Migration Watch then has to estimate what percentage of natural change is down to migration. This is done by estimating the number of children born to non-UK born parents each year, using official data. The calculations we’ve seen are accurate. That said, it’s not possible to get a perfect measure for this—for example there’s the question of how to count a child born to one immigrant parent and one UK-born parent, as opposed to one with two immigrant parents. The research chose to count a child with one of each as 50% linked to migration. Migration Watch also has to estimate the number of deaths of immigrants and the children of immigrants each year. We haven’t seen the data on deaths of immigrants (as it’s not publicly available), and data on deaths doesn’t record whether or not someone is the child of an immigrant, so Migration Watch have produced a calculation which involves “a degree of assumption and interpolation”. The complexities of the calculation mean the numbers it produces are unlikely to be perfect. Indeed, based on its calculations, Migration Watch notes that there are slight disparities between what its estimates put population growth at each year, and the official data.  This is not a significant disparity however, and the figures broadly fit with what wider data tells us about migration. As outlined above, we know net migration has been rising in the last fifteen years. Births to immigrant mothers have also been rising since the 1990s, as the chart below shows. Another reason why the 82% figure should not be treated as perfect is that the official data (used by Migration Watch) may well be giving inaccurate estimates of net migration. It shows that the level of net immigration to the UK among non-EU citizens has been significant in the last ten years—with a cumulative increase of over 1.5 million people (before accounting for any deaths). However, UK population data tells a different story, showing that the growth of the non-EU-born population has been smaller (closer to one million). On the flipside, it could be undercounting the number of EU migrants who move to the UK. We’ve looked before at the reasons why this is happening (here). In short, we can’t know for sure whether the overall estimates are accurate or not, so this serves as a warning against treating migration figures as exact. The 2011 census also revealed that the survey which measures net migration data had been doing so inaccurately. Net migration figures between 2001 and 2011 were revised up as a result. We won’t know until after the next census in 2021 if that is still an issue. Numbers aside, the headline phrasing that over 80% of population growth is “linked” to migration has caused some controversy. It has been argued that, by combining migrants and their children into one figure “linked” to migration, Migration Watch is making the “assumption that the British born children of migrants are in some sense migrants”, or less integrated into the population. Migration Watch argues that it is undertaking a demographic analysis rather than an ethnic or cultural one. We don’t seek to comment on this debate. In any case, it’s helpful to break down the 82% figure into its constituent parts, and understand that it is the product of several trends. Otherwise, newspaper headlines about population change being linked to migration risk masking the complexities of the calculation. Update 19 September 2018  We previously compared net migration data on non-EU citizens with population data on the number of non-EU citizens, to show differences between the two datasets. We altered the comparison to look at population data on non-EU-born individuals, rather than non-EU citizens, as the data is more useful for comparison.","“Linked to” here combines an estimate of both net migration and children born to immigrant parents. This is likely to be on the right scale but too precise a figure, as it rests on a number of assumptions and uncertain data sources.

112,fullfact,"Under the government’s new immigration rules anyone earning less than £25,600 is regarded as an unskilled worker.
","An image of a tweet, shared 5,000 times on Facebook, claims that under the government’s new immigration rules anyone earning less than £25,600 is classed as an unskilled worker. It then lists various health professions for which the starting salary is under £25,600. It isn’t correct to say that these professions are classed as unskilled. Newly qualified people in these roles, with the exception of care assistants, meet the immigration skills threshold. Care assistants do meet the threshold in certain circumstances. These claims stem from the government’s recent announcement that it would be introducing a “points-based” immigration system . Not all the details of the new immigration system have been confirmed. However, what we know is that under the new system, all applicants must: In addition they must meet a salary level which varies depending on circumstances. Their salary offer must be: In general, visa applicants must also have a salary offer at the “going rate”, which essentially means that they are paid competitively for the job they’re applying for. However, there will be exceptions to this requirement for some occupations that work on published pay scales, and also for new entrants. The tweet implies that as new starters to the NHS in various roles have salaries below the required minimum, and so the government considers nurses, paramedics, midwives, radiographers, care assistants, physiotherapists and occupational therapists “unskilled.” It implies this by correctly listing the starting salary of £24,200 for all these roles, with the exception of care assistants who start on £17,600. But jobs aren’t classed as skilled based on salary. The skills threshold is set at something called “regulation qualification” level 3 (RQF 3) or above. All of these professions listed except care assistants are at RQF 6 and so meet the skills threshold. Care assistants only meet the government’s immigration skills threshold if they have a certain level of seniority and/or experience.   Additionally, someone with a job offer to do any of the listed jobs apart from care assistants and physiotherapists would be immediately eligible to apply for a work visa under the new system because they are considered shortage occupations. This is provided they meet the other mandatory criteria of being able to speak English and have a salary offer of £20,480 or above. All the starting salaries mentioned in the image are correct, for England in 2019/20. Qualified nurses tend to start on a band 5, which is currently £24,214. Paramedics, midwives, radiographers, physiotherapists and occupational therapists also start at a band 5. Care assistants tend to start on a band 2, which is £17,652.     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as partly false        because while most of the salaries are accurate, it is incorrect to claim that anyone earning less than £25,600 is considered an unskilled worker under the new migration policy.    ","Incorrect. All workers applying for the skilled worker visa must have a salary of at least £20,480, and if it is below £25,600 they must also fulfil other criteria to gain a visa.

113,fullfact,"Home Office figures suggest new immigration rules will mean a reduction in unskilled EU migration of 90,000.
","“Skilled migration to the UK will rise under radical reforms to immigration that Boris Johnson signed off last week… “Home Office figures suggest the new rules will mean an overnight reduction in unskilled EU migrants of about 90,000 a year, who will no longer have a route into Britain.” The Sunday Times, 9 February 2020 An article in yesterday’s Sunday Times claimed that the government’s planned change to immigration rules will reduce unskilled EU migration to the UK by around 90,000 a year. The Sunday Times also reported that “the number of skilled migrants coming to the UK … [is] currently 65,000 a year. At the moment they are split equally between EU and non-EU migrants.” This appears to show the Home Office briefing two incompatible numbers. As economics professor Jonathan Portes pointed out, the total number of migrants who came from the EU for work in the year ending June 2019 totalled 90,000. If there are only 90,000 EU migrants coming to the UK for work and roughly 32,500 (half of 65,000) are skilled, then around 57,500 must be unskilled. You can’t reduce 57,500 by 90,000. Professor Portes told us that migrants are only assessed as being skilled or unskilled if they are making a work visa application, not if they are planning to migrate to the UK for any other reason, such as joining family or for study. We asked the Home Office for more details on the figures which, according to the Sunday Times, came from them. A spokesperson told us: “We will deliver on the people’s priorities by introducing a points-based immigration system from 2021 to attract the brightest and best talent from around the world, while cutting low-skilled immigration and bringing overall numbers down. We will set out the details of this firmer and fairer new system in due course.” It’s inappropriate for government departments to use figures that aren’t in the public domain, and figures like these should be published in full so that anyone can check where they’re from and how they’re calculated. We would ask the Home Office to publish its figures and methodology at the earliest opportunity. Reducing the number of EU migrants by 90,000 could be mathematically possible if you looked at all EU migrants, not just those coming to the UK for work-related reasons. For example, new laws could plan to reduce the number of both work-related migrants and non-work-related migrants. Or it’s possible that by reducing the number of unskilled migrants, there’s an associated reduction in the number of people migrating for non-work reasons (for example coming to stay with these workers under family visas).   It’s also possible that the Home Office briefed out-of-date-figures forecasting how much immigration might be reduced by, but which are not applicable now EU migration has dropped since the EU referendum.  But the Sunday Times mentions the figure specifically in the context of reducing the number of “unskilled EU migrants.” So even if the government’s plans could lead to a fall in EU migration of 90,000 it’s incorrect, based on the figures we have, to suggest that all of this will come from unskilled workers.","The number of unskilled EU migrants coming to work in the UK is already less than 90,000, so the government cannot cut it by 90,000 with changes to immigration rules.

But not all of these were unaccompanied. 11,338 (27%) were classified by the Home Office as an unaccompanied asylum seeking child while 16,671 (40%) were accompanied. The remaining 13,387 young people granted leave to remain were part of resettlement schemes. We cannot tell from these statistics whether these young people were accompanied by a parent or carer, or if they were unaccompanied. The Home Office confirmed to us that 41,000 was the figure for the total number of children granted protection since 2010. Update 3 February 2020  Updated following confirmation of the statistics from the Home Office. Correction 6 February 2020  We corrected this article to clarify that the 41,000 figure included both asylum seekers and refugees under the age of 18.","Since 2010, the UK has granted protection to 41,396 asylum seekers and refugees under the age of 18.

115,fullfact,"Migration has amounted to 80% of UK population growth.
","“Migration has amounted to, I think, 80% of the population increase, which is about one million every three years.” Iain Duncan Smith MP, 15 January 2020 On the Today programme, former Conservative party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith was asked about the government’s migration plans. He claimed that migration accounts for 80% of the population increase in the UK, amounting to one million people every three years. Since 2000 the UK population has increased by about 7.8 million. Of that, 4.6 million (60%) is the increase from net migration (the number of migrants coming to the UK, minus the number leaving). In recent years, it’s amounted to around 900,000 every three years and it’s been lower before that. This is according to the best available figures, though these still carry some uncertainty. Between 2017 and 2018, the increase in net migration made up closer to 70% of the change in population. Net migration has not directly accounted for 80% of the population increase at any point recently. So the figures mentioned by Sir Iain don’t appear to refer to net migration alone. However they could refer to research which looks not just at the direct population increase due to migration, but the indirect increase from children born to immigrant parents as well. This research puts the population increase due to migration at 82% of total population growth—equivalent to roughly a million people every three years between 2001 and 2016. As we’ve said before, this higher figure shouldn’t be taken as precise, as there isn’t enough data available to reach an accurate estimate of the population of children born to immigrant parents. It does, however, give an indication of the rough scale if you choose to include children in this way when talking about the impacts of migration. In any case, given that there are a number of ways to look at these figures, it’s unhelpful to describe this as the impact of “migration” on population growth without any context of what’s being counted.","This combines a rough estimate of both migration to and from the UK and children born to immigrant parents. Without counting children, migration directly accounts for 60% of UK population growth since 2000.

116,fullfact,"Labour pledged to scrap all controls on immigration
","“Labour to scrap all controls on immigration” The Telegraph front page, 26 September 2019. Following the conclusion of the Labour Party conference on Wednesday, the front page of the Telegraph’s Thursday edition reported that the party had agreed a policy to remove all controls on immigration. This is incorrect, as the Labour party pointed out. At its annual conference, Labour passed a broad proposal for its future migration policy. The motion said Labour will include manifesto pledges to, among other things, “maintain and extend free movement rights”, “close all detention centres”  and to “reject any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps/targets.” The full text of the proposal is available here. Afterwards, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott was quoted by the Guardian as saying: “Be assured, our plans for government include these provisions and a lot more,” indicating that the proposal would be adopted as party policy. The provisions laid out in the motion do seem to represent significant reductions in the barriers to immigrants coming to the UK and settling here. However claiming these proposals amount to the removal of “all controls on immigration” is exaggeration. Currently, EU citizens have the have the right to live and work in the UK (as an EU member state), with some exceptions. Labour’s motion plans to maintain this but does not specify how far it would extend rights of free movement (for example whether it would be applied to citizens of any other countries). Non-EU citizens are subject to more controls and enforcement, some of which the conference motion wants to relax, but it’s far from clear at this stage how far the party would want those changes to go. The motion doesn’t rule out all possible controls on migration—only certain types of immigration system.    It’s also important to note that a motion passing conference is a fairly early stage of the policy development cycle. The motion will now be fleshed out by the party. While it’s possible this could extend to scrapping all controls on immigration, claiming this is what was voted for yesterday is disingenuous.   The Telegraph’s article online didn’t contain the word “all” in the headline and copy. The headline online reads : “Labour to scrap controls on immigration and hand foreign nationals the right to vote.”","Incorrect. Labour passed a motion at its party conference to extend free movement and ruling out certain forms of immigration systems. This doesn’t mean scrapping all immigration controls.

117,fullfact,"If you come to the UK illegally, you are an illegal migrant, and I’m afraid the law will treat you as such.
","“The UK should not be regarded as a place where you can automatically come and break the law by seeking to arrive illegally. If you come illegally, you are an illegal migrant, and I’m afraid the law will treat you as such.” Boris Johnson, 23 August 2019 In reference to migrants attempting to cross the Channel to get from France to the UK, Boris Johnson said “If you come illegally, you are an illegal migrant, and I’m afraid the law will treat you as such.” This is not correct in all cases. Although it’s certainly true that crossing the Channel without authorisation isn’t a legal way to enter the UK, Article 31 of the UN Refugee Convention states that refugees cannot be penalised for entering the country illegally to claim asylum if they are “coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened” provided they “present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence”. A lot depends here on how to interpret which country people are “coming directly from”. It could be argued, for instance, that as the people crossing the channel are coming directly from France—which is not the country they initially fled—they don’t have the right to claim asylum in the UK. However, in 1999 a UK judge ruled that “some element of choice is indeed open to refugees as to where they may properly claim asylum.” The judge specified that “any merely short term stopover en route” to another country should not forfeit the individual’s right to claim refugee status elsewhere. This means people who enter the UK by illegal means can legitimately make a claim for asylum, even after passing through other “safe” countries, provided they do so directly after arriving. We’ve written about the rights of refugees in greater detail here. When Mr Johnson first made his statement on Friday, the Guardian politics liveblog called his statement misleading, after a reader alerted them to our original article.","Not in all cases. Specifically, refugees seeking asylum in the UK can’t be penalised for entering illegally if they are claiming asylum and coming from a place where their life or freedom are threatened. They may also stop over in other “safe” countries en route to the UK.

118,fullfact,"Mass immigration has depressed wages, especially on the low skill level.
","“I agree that unfettered mass immigration has been used to depress wages, especially on the low skill level.” Lionel Shriver, 24 May 2018 “If you look at the evidence of why we have seen wages going down, there is actually very little evidence that that is being caused by migration, aside from in construction.” Anneliese Dodds, 24 May 2018 Both panellists hit on a key point: the impact of immigration on wages depends on who you are, what kind of job you do and where you do it. It also might not be the same from year to year. It is difficult to measure the overall effects of immigration on jobs definitively. Studies that have tried to do it in the UK have sometimes reached opposing conclusions about whether it increases or decreases wages overall but they tend to agree that immigration has a small impact on average wages of existing workers. The effects of immigration on workers within specific wage ranges or in specific occupations are more significant. There is quite a lot of evidence that immigration affects low-waged workers the most negatively, and not just in construction. The available research also shows that any declines in wages are likely to be greatest for resident workers who are themselves migrants. This is because the skills of new immigrants are likely to be more similar to the skills of migrants already employed in the UK than for those of UK-born workers. Declines in the wages and employment of UK-born workers in the short run can be offset by rising wages and employment in the long run. Read our full briefing on How immigrants affect jobs and wages, which was written by Oxford University’s Migration Observatory in collaboration with Full Fact. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Studies find that immigration affects low-waged workers the most negatively.

119,fullfact,"A 10% rise in immigration leads to a 2% reduction in wages.
","“As the Bank of England said, for every 10% growth in immigration there is a 2% reduction in wages. That bears thinking about.” Boris Johnson, ITV, 9 June 2016 The 10% to 2% ratio, described by the Bank of England, does not show the relationship between changes in the immigration rate and UK average wages, as has been claimed. Their report was much more specific than this. The report suggested that an increase in the ratio of foreign-born workers to UK-born workers in lower-paid service occupations caused a small but significant reduction in the average pay for low paid workers in that region. It found that a 1.88% reduction in pay for semi-skilled and unskilled service workers would be expected to follow, on average, a 10% increase in the proportion of immigrants working in those jobs in a particular region. Examples of jobs in this category include child minders, cleaners, shop assistants, call centre staff, bar staff and postal workers. The reduction in average pay for semi-skilled and unskilled service workers is mainly due to a drop in wages for low-paid workers born in the UK. A small part is because immigrants tend to be paid less than native workers, bringing the average down further. The Bank of England also found that an increase in the ratio of foreign-born to UK-born workers seemed to have an effect on the average UK wage nationally. This effect was much smaller than the effect found when the report focused on particular groups of occupation. Whether the immigrant workers had come from inside or outside the EU made very little difference. Between 2004-2006 and 2012-2014 the ratio of foreign-born to UK-born workers rose by about 8% in low-skilled and semi-skilled service occupations across the UK as a whole. This was the largest change in any of the four occupational groups classified by the report. So for a low-skilled or semi-skilled occupation paid £8 per hour, this would work out to a drop of between 1 and 2 pence per hour, each year. Many issues have an affect on the wages of the lowest paid. Academics commonly list global changes in technology and trade, or national differences in education, attitudes to gender, and union activity as having a much more significant effect than having a higher proportion of immigrants in the workforce.","The Bank of England found that a 10% increase in the proportion of foreign born workers in lower paid service jobs was associated with a near 2% fall in average pay for those jobs, when focusing on particular regions.

120,fullfact,"58% of people in the UK would be comfortable with a female head of state.
","“The Reykjavik Index for Leadership ranks… G7 countries in terms of the percentage of people who would be comfortable with a female head of state. The U.K., which is currently led by Prime Minister Theresa May, came first with 58%” Axios, 27 November 2018 Market research company Kantar recently put out some figures about how different countries view female leaders. It surveyed around 900 working-age adults (age 18 to 64) in each of the G7 countries (UK, USA, France, Canada, Japan, Germany and Italy). In four of the seven countries less than half of people would be “very comfortable” with a female head of government, according to Kantar’s findings. In the UK, the published figures show 58% of people would feel “very comfortable” with a female head of government.    But it’s not correct to say based on this that 58% are “comfortable”. Nor is it correct to assume that everyone who didn’t say they were “very comfortable” with a female leader is uncomfortable. Here’s why: Kantar told us that the exact question asked was: “How comfortable do you or would you personally feel about having a woman as the head of government in your country?” That hypothetical phrasing was used even if the country actually had a female head of government—as is the case in the UK and Germany. (And it’s possible that fact in itself would have influenced the results in those countries). The answers respondents could choose from ranged from very or fairly comfortable to not very or not at all comfortable. They could also choose ‘don’t know’. So respondents could choose a range of options to express how comfortable with a female leader they were. The report by Kantar shows us that many people answered “very comfortable” but not how many answered with the other options. So although 58% of people in the UK were ‘very comfortable’ with the idea of a female head of government, the proportion that were either fairly or very comfortable was higher. By the same reasoning, you also can’t infer from the published data how many people in each country would be uncomfortable with a female head of state. Kantar gave us the full UK results to the question. These showed that in the UK, 58% of people said they were “very comfortable” with a female leader and another 29% said they were “fairly comfortable”. 9% said they were not very or not at all comfortable.  There’s a limit to how much the data can tell us about attitudes towards women as heads of government across the G7. Kantar didn’t ask respondents how they would feel about having a male head of government—so we can’t compare the two sets of figures. It also didn’t ask any follow up questions as to why people were comfortable (or not) with women as heads of government—for example if it was linked to their gender, the performance of particular high profile politicians, or a general distrust of politicians. Kantar did ask respondents whether they thought men or women are more suitable for leadership positions in government and politics more widely (rather than as the out-and-out head of state).

123,fullfact,"Jeremy Corbyn will cost every British worker £2,400 per year.
","“The true 'cost of Corbyn': £2,400 a year for every British worker, claim Tories” The Telegraph, 12 November 2019 The Conservatives have claimed that every taxpayer in the UK will have an additional bill of £2,400 per year under Labour. But problems with the calculation make this claim largely meaningless. They estimated the total cost of Labour’s policies over five years, and then estimated that, of that sum, £374 billion would not be covered by Labour’s previous pledges on additional borrowing or taxes. They call this a £374 billion funding “black hole” which taxpayers will have to cover, and claim it translates into a cost of £2,400 per income tax payer per year, over five years. But, as we’ve already said, the Conservatives’ estimate of the total cost of Labour’s policies has serious problems. They can’t know what the Labour party’s policies will cost because Labour hasn’t released its 2019 election manifesto yet and we don’t know exactly what all its policies will be. The Conservatives’ calculation includes a number of policies that Labour hasn’t so far said will be in its manifesto, and one which it has ruled out. Other calculations made by the Conservatives seem overstated, either by double counting costs or assuming Labour would introduce the fully-fledged policy from day one, rather than phasing it in. Because this £2,400 a year figure is derived from that larger estimate, it suffers from the same flaws. Those problems aside, it’s not possible to convert the supposed £374 billion funding “black hole” into a uniform cost of £2,400 for every one of the UK’s 31 million income tax payers, as the Conservatives have done. That’s because if Labour had to raise this extra revenue, it wouldn’t be obliged to do it through income tax. It could, for example, look at corporation tax or VAT instead, which would still be a cost but to different groups and spread out unevenly. And even if it raised the revenue through higher income tax, higher earners pay more income tax—meaning they would pay more than lower earners. BBC Reality Check also points out that the Conservatives’ assumptions about Labour’s tax-raising plans rely on documents which Labour has not formally adopted as party policy.","This figure is largely meaningless as the calculations and assumptions behind it have a number of flaws.

124,fullfact,"Labour’s spending plans would cost £1.2 trillion over five years.
","“Corbyn’s Labour would spend £1.2 trillion over the next five years if they get elected”. Conservative party, 10 November 2019 On Sunday a number of front pages carried the story that Conservative analysis of Labour party policies put the cost of a Labour government at £1.2 trillion over five years. The Conservatives’ analysis is looking at policies put forward by the Labour party in their 2017 election manifesto, or in the two years since. But the Labour party hasn’t released its 2019 election manifesto yet, so it’s impossible to know exactly what its policies would be if in government. It’s impossible to cost a manifesto that hasn’t been released yet. As no other party has released its manifesto either, it’s also impossible to compare to the cost of any other party’s policies (including the Conservatives’). The list includes a number of policies that Labour hasn’t so far said will be in its manifesto and one (the abolition of private schools) that Labour has ruled out. Other numbers seem overstated, either by double counting costs or assuming Labour would introduce the fully fledged policy from day one, rather than phasing it in. Some of the figures are reasonable, and some are taken directly from Labour’s own announcements. Over half of the £1.2 trillion figure is based on the Conservatives’ estimate of the cost of Labour’s 2017 manifesto, but it’s not clear how many policies from that will appear in the 2019 version. Around half of the £1.2 trillion over five years comes from a costing of Labour’s 2017 election manifesto. It includes figures put forward by Labour at the time as well as the Conservatives’ estimate of Labour’s ‘uncosted’ spending from the manifesto. In 2017 Labour said that its manifesto policies would cost £48.6 billion a year in day to day spending. Over five years that’s £243 billion. At the time, Labour also put forward tax measures it claimed would pay for that spending. Labour also said in 2017 it wanted to spend around £25 billion a year on infrastructure and investment—over five years that’s £125 billion. When the 2017 Labour manifesto was originally published the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that a number of Labour’s policies could turn out to be more costly than it had estimated. That still leaves another £243 billion that the Conservatives say is ‘uncosted spending’ from the last manifesto. A large chunk of this comes from the supposed cost of Labour’s plans to renationalise rail, energy networks, water and postal services which the Conservatives have factored in at £196 billion.  This figure comes from analysis by the CBI, and when we fact checked it back in October we found that the methodology behind the figure was disputed and didn’t take into account the potential economic benefits of nationalisation. The Conservatives also seem to have double counted the cost of renationalising the National Grid under both Labour’s 2017 manifesto and under new spending since then. The National Grid is part of the £196 billion price tag for nationalisation from Labour’s 2017 manifesto, according to the CBI’s analysis. But it’s also reportedly part of a separate £124 billion pot of money the Conservatives say is the cost of renationalising the ‘Big Six’ energy supply companies—an extension of Labour’s 2017 energy pledges. The £124 billion figure is based on analysis by stock brokerage firm Jefferies from 2015. As far as we can tell, Jefferies never publicly released their methodology, but multiple press reports at the time said that it was an estimate of the cost of nationalising the Big Six as well as the National Grid.  According to a chart in the Guardian based on Jefferies’ figures, just under £60 billion of the £124 billion estimate was due to the value of the National Grid. The Conservatives also said that Labour’s plan to upgrade UK housing and install energy saving measures will cost £30 billion over five years.  This figure does seem to be in line with Labour’s own calculations. When it announced the policy last week it said it would cost £250 billion in total, with £60 billion of that coming from public spending under a Labour government by 2030. The Conservatives have taken this total for around 10 years and halved it to get a five year figure of £30 billion. Another figure which seems to originate with Labour is the £50 billion allocated to a housing grant for socially rented homes. A motion voted for at Labour’s party conference called on the party to commit to setting aside £10 billion a year to build 100,000 socially rented homes. That doesn’t mean this is definitely going to be in Labour’s 2019 manifesto. The Conservatives multiplied £10 billion by five to get to £50 billion, which assumes that Labour would start implementing the policy straight away once in government. Labour recently announced at its party conference in September that in government it would look to reduce the average full-time working week to 32 hours within the next decade. The Conservatives say this will cost £85 billion over five years, or £17 billion a year.  That is based on research done by the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), a centre-right think tank, which estimated that moving to a 32 hour week would cost between £26 billion and £45 billion a year, depending on how you calculated the average number of hours people work at the moment. The CPS also said that in an “incredibly optimistic” scenario, increased productivity from working longer hours could generate £9 billion, leaving the cost of the policy at at least £17 billion. But the Conservatives seem to have assumed that Labour would introduce this policy from day one of a Labour government, rather than phasing it in over a decade as Labour have previously said.  The Conservatives say £35 billion of the total cost would come from Labour’s policy to abolish private schools.  Labour said in a press release on 31 October this year that this was not its policy. The Labour party conference in September did pass a vote supporting the integration of private schools into the state sector and the redistribution of their assets, but that does not commit the party to including the policy in its manifesto.  The currently stated Labour policy is to remove charitable status and various tax benefits from private schools, and then (as their press release put it) “ask the Social Justice Commission to consider the ways in which we can integrate private schools into the state sector”. But even if it was Labour policy, the Conservatives’ calculations are flawed.  The Conservatives added together estimates from consultancy Oxford Economics for the amount they say independent schools save the taxpayer by teaching pupils who would otherwise have a state education (£3.5 billion per year) and the amount of tax revenue generated from independent schools (£3.5 billion per year), and multiplied by five to get the £35 billion figure.  The Conservatives actually used the wrong figure for the amount of revenue generated by private schools. Oxford Economics estimated that independent schools contributed £4.1 billion of tax per year (£3.5 billion was only a subset of independent schools).  Regardless, it’s wrong to say that closing private schools would mean the government sees a reduction in tax revenues. The tax revenue figure covers tax currently generated through spending by independent schools. This includes things like tax paid by teachers and tax generated when schools buy things, but a lot of that would be generated if the private schools closed and the state sector had to expand too.  Estimations like these are uncertain, but a better estimate is that moving privately educated pupils into the state sector would cost £3.5 billion a year—half of what the Conservatives have estimated.  Around £67 billion in the analysis comes from what the Conservatives say is Labour’s policy of “early retirement for women born in the 1950s”. In 2017, after the general election, Labour pledged to “allow these women to retire up to two years early.” The state pension age is rising and in 2011 the government passed measures to speed up how quickly this was happening, meaning almost five million people would not be able to claim the state pension until later than they originally thought.  The Conservatives said they took the average value of the state pension for women in 2018/19 and multiplied by the additional number of people who would receive the state pension under Labour’s plans for a duration of two years. This includes back-payments for women who didn’t receive their pension so soon.  We haven’t been able to replicate the Conservatives’ calculations and there is not enough detail on Labour’s proposals to accurately estimate the cost of their policy. We’ve asked both for more information. Another figure that the Conservatives have taken straight from Labour is the proposed cost of upgrading school buildings. In 2018 Labour said it would spend £14 billion to upgrade school buildings, and that would include fire safety measures such as fitting sprinklers and removing potentially flammable cladding. It’s unclear what period Labour intended this to be spent over. The Conservatives say Labour’s plans on public sector pay would cost around £38 billion over five years. That’s based on a statement Jeremy Corbyn made in July 2018, backing trade union calls for a 5% rise in public sector pay.  The Conservatives’ cost estimate is based on the above-inflation cost of a 5% pay rise every year for five years (though we’ve not been able to replicate their exact calculations). But there’s no suggestion from Labour that the demand for a 5% pay rise was intended to be every year, so this could overstate Labour’s intentions. The Conservative party seems to have tried to avoid double counting in this instance. Its initial estimate of this policy was £58 billion, but around £20 billion of the amount was already included in Labour’s costings of their 2017 manifesto. Labour estimated lifting the public sector pay cap would cost £4 billion a year (we fact checked this in 2017 and found it was a reasonable estimate for raising public sector pay in line with inflation). The Conservatives say that Labour’s public health pledges would cost £3.2 billion per year or £16 billion over five.  That is based on Labour’s repetition of the Health Foundation’s calculations from 2018 that an additional £3.2 billion a year is needed to reverse the impact of decreased funding to public health services. We can’t find evidence that Labour has actually pledged to increase spending by this amount if it got into government, although Johnathan Ashworth did ask ministers in 2018 to reverse the cuts in that year’s budget. The Conservatives calculate that scrapping Universal Credit will cost £16 billion, and point to multiple associated costs: infrastructure for a new benefit system; ending the benefit cap; ending the two child limit; and recruiting 5,000 additional advisers. These are all things which Labour has pledged to do. By far the biggest single estimated cost is almost £15 billion, which the Conservatives say is the cost of Labour’s pledge to remove the two child limit which means most parents can only receive child tax credit for the first two children they have. The Conservatives say the two child limit “was estimated to have saved” £3 billion a year. This seems to come from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), which says the two child limit is expected to reduce government spending by £3 billion “in the long run”. The Conservatives used this as an annual figure and factored in that changes to this policy were made in 2019 which cost around £250 million. But £3 billion wouldn’t be wouldn’t be the cost of reversing the policy in each of the next five years. The two child limit was expected to lead to spending reductions of £310 million in 2017/18, rising to £1.6 billion in 2020/21 and £2 billion by 2021/22, according to the House of Commons Library, so it hasn’t yet reached the £3 billion figure projected by the IFS. The Conservative party also claims that ending the benefit cap will cost £190 million a year, or £950 million over five years. Its source is a parliamentary report which says the £190 million figure is “likely to be an overestimate”.  The Conservatives estimated that Labour’s pledge to deliver free personal care in England would cost £32 billion over five years. This seems fair.  Personal care is help for those who need assistance with things like diet, mobility and simple treatments, and is already free in Scotland. Healthcare think tank The King’s Fund estimated expanding this to England would cost an extra £6 billion in 2020/21 and £8 billion by 2030/31.  The Conservatives assumed an incremental increase in cost of £0.2 billion a year over the first five years, getting to £32 billion over the whole period. At the time of writing, Labour hadn’t yet released its manifesto for the 2019 election, so we don’t know exactly which policies it will include or how much they’re likely to cost. Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said in response to the Conservatives’ analysis: “This ludicrous piece of Tory fake news is an incompetent mish-mash of debunked estimates and bad maths… The Conservatives will be able to read all about [Labour’s] plans – and how much they actually cost – when we publish our fully costed manifesto.”","Labour hasn’t published its 2019 manifesto yet, so nobody knows. This is largely based on Labour’s previous policy announcements. Many of the figures behind this estimate are uncertain or based on flawed assumptions.

125,fullfact,"Ian Austin, former Labour MP has said he won’t vote for Labour.
","Today Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott tweeted about media coverage of former Labour MP Ian Austin, claiming that it was unbalanced when contrasted with coverage of comments made recently by former Conservative MP and Chancellor Ken Clarke.   Ian Austin, 1 year as a junior minister at DCLG, says he won't vote for Labour. Wall-to-wall coverage. Ken Clarke, 9 years as Secretary of State, including as Chancellor, says he won't vote for the Conservatives. Silence. Balanced election coverage? While it’s true that the two sets of comments received different levels of media attention, Ms Abbott’s phrasing doesn’t portray them entirely accurately, overstating what Ken Clarke said and implying the two sets of comments to be more similar than they are. Mr Austin didn’t just say he personally wouldn’t vote Labour this election; this morning he explicitly called on Labour voters to vote for the Conservatives. Meanwhile Ken Clarke did not say he “won’t vote for the Conservatives.” He did say that it was a possibility that he would not, but that it would depend on the campaign the Conservative party ran, and that he did not expect them to run a campaign which would cost them his vote. On 1 November he told Channel 4 News (after prefacing his statement with “I’m slightly teasing you and myself”) that his voting Conservative was “not as certain as it has been in previous elections.” He added: “It depends what sort of campaign the party run. If we really do make ourselves the Brexit Party under our brand, my loyalty is going to be strained absolutely… I am not voting for some crazy right-wing nationalist organisation calling themselves a Conservative government—but that I think is laying it on a bit, I don't think that’s where we’ll wind up.” It’s perfectly true to say, as Ms Abbott does, that Mr Clarke’s comments received relatively limited media attention while Mr Austin’s have been widely reported. And it’s a legitimate matter of opinion as to whether media coverage of the two events has shown an imbalance against Labour or not. But presenting the two sets of comments in a way that makes them seem precisely equivalent, to justify that charge of imbalance, is misleading.","Correct. He also asked Labour voters to vote for the Conservatives.

126,fullfact,"The government is spending £14 billion on primary and secondary education between now and 2022/23.
","“We're levelling up schools across the country by investing over £14 billion in primary and secondary education between now and 2022/23.” 10 Downing Street Twitter account, 31 August 2019 Last week the government announced a new package of spending for primary and secondary schools in England, which it claimed would total over £14 billion between 2019/20 and 2022/23. But Paul Johnson, Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has described this figure as “somewhere between meaningless and misleading”. The government’s announcement set out that, compared to this year, spending would be £2.6 billion higher in 2020/21, £4.8 billion higher the year after, and £7.1 billion higher in 2022/23. That all adds up to £14.5 billion, but, as we’ve said before when the government made similar claims about the NHS, adding up multiple years funding is an unhelpful way to look at the spending increase. A number of news outlets chose not to report the £14 billion figure for that reason. As we’ve said before, adding several years of spending together is simply not the normal way politicians talk about spending increases. They most commonly refer to spending on a per-year basis, or talking about the difference between the first and final year of spending. It’s not factually wrong—but it could be misleading.  Spending is planned to increase by £7.1 billion between now and 2022/23, but that also doesn’t account for inflation (the change in how much things cost over time). The £7 billion increase in spending by 2022/23 is actually £4.3 billion once inflation is accounted for, according to the IFS. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said: “Since 2009-10, school spending per pupil has fallen by 8% in real-terms in England. “The new spending plans should be near enough sufficient to reverse these cuts by 2022-23.”","The increase is £4.3 billion by 2022/23 once you account for inflation. The £14 billion figure is unhelpful as it is the figure you get if you add up all the extra money spent on education in each year to 2022/23 compared to 2019/20 and doesn’t account for inflation.

New laws on workplace rights have come into effect.
","“Workers on zero-hour contracts, agency employees or ""gig economy"" workers are to be better protected by a package of workplace reforms, the government says. “Under new legislation to be introduced on Monday, staff would have to be told details of their rights from their first day in a job, including eligibility for paid and sick leave.” BBC News, 17 December 2018   “The government has introduced what it claims to be the biggest package of workplace reforms for 20 years after concerns that ministers have failed to appeal to voters who are “just about managing”. “Legislation that comes into effect on Monday will increase fines for employers who have deliberately victimised their staff, and give workers details of their rights from the first day in their job.” Guardian, 17 December 2018  Today, the BBC and the Guardian have both reported on new legislation on workplace reform, but depending on which media outlet you read the government has either just introduced this legislation today or the legislation is coming into effect today.  So what has happened? The government has said that today it will be introducing draft legislation  on workers’ rights, including changes to the legal protections for workers on zero-hour contracts.  Business secretary Greg Clark made a written statement to parliament saying:  “Today, we have also taken the important first step in implementing the Good Work Plan, bringing forward new legislation to provide further rights to workers and ban unfair practices.” But it’s not correct to say, as the Guardian did, that legislation is coming into effect today. The BBC said more correctly that government is introducing legislation to parliament, but introducing it is not a guarantee it will eventually come into effect. Any new legislation needs to be debated by both MPs and Lords, reviewed by committees and passed by parliament before it becomes law and takes effect. What the government is technically doing today is telling parliament it intends to legislate to change some workers’ rights. So far as we’ve been able to determine the draft legal texts haven’t yet been published or presented to parliament.","
 
Incorrect. The government has made a statement to parliament saying they intend to introduce new laws to change workers’ rights. But these new rights haven’t been passed as law and so aren’t in effect.

For every donation the charity organisers take 1.98% off the fee plus 20p per each donation.
","A number of Facebook posts, shared hundreds of times each, share images of a WhatsApp message that makes a number of claims about the well-publicised fundraiser Captain Tom Moore is doing for NHS Charities Together. It makes claims about the amount of money the “charity organisers” are taking, and alleges that Captain Tom’s family benefits from the money raised. This is incorrect. It is correct that JustGiving keeps a percentage of the money raised through donations which goes towards service fees and operating costs. The figure given in the message may have been roughly accurate when the posts were published, and is now probably an underestimate. JustGiving told us that over 97% of the money raised goes to charity. We’ve written more about that here. JustGiving also told us that the Maytrix Group, the company run by Captain Tom’s daughter and son-in-law, does not receive any money from the fundraiser.   “Captain Tom and his charity walk has raised 15.5 million with over 750,000 people donating” The amount raised has now far exceeded that. At the time of writing, over £31 million has been donated to Captain Tom’s fundraiser by over 1.3 million supporters, in aid of NHS Charities Together. Donations were at £15 million on 16 April. These figures don’t include Gift Aid that could be claimed back and which currently amounts to an additional £6 million. Gift Aid allows charities to boost the value of donations from taxpayers by 25%. It essentially means that cash donations are treated as having been tax free, allowing charities to claim back the tax from HMRC.   “for every donation the charity organisers take 1.98% off the fee plus 20p per each donation” It’s slightly unclear what is meant here by the “charity organisers”. As we’ve said before, JustGiving charges payment processing fees for card or Paypal payments, which is 1.9% of the donation plus 20p. JustGiving says this charge “accounts for the varying costs of processing different payment types”. Donations made in another currency have a processing fee of 2.9% of the donation plus 20p.  JustGiving also told us it keeps around 1% of the total donations to cover operating costs, though it was not able to give an exact figure for this as donations keep rising. The platform has donated £100,000 to the fundraiser.   “then if you request gift aid they take 5% of the gift aid before passing it on” As we’ve also said before, if a donor adds Gift Aid onto their donation, JustGiving deducts a 5% Gift Aid processing service fee. This is collected separately from the donations made. At the time of writing, almost £6 million in Gift Aid had been collected (meaning a 5% processing fee would come to almost £300,000).   “so in total the charity organisers have made £600,000, not bad eh.. from what I can gather the charity organisers on just giving I believe are called maytrix.. oh the people who own/set up matrix is only captain toms daughter and son in law” The £600,000 estimate for fees taken by JustGiving may have been in the right ballpark when the Facebook posts were published, but the real total is  now likely higher than this as the total raised has also increased. Captain Tom’s daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, did help her father set up the fundraiser. She is also, along with her husband, the director of a company called the Maytrix Group. Speaking on LBC Radio, Ms Ingram-Moore also said that her company was initially sponsoring Captain Tom £1 per length he walked. Maytrix receives no money from Captain Tom’s fundraiser. A spokesperson for JustGiving confirmed to us that none of the money goes to the Maytrix Group and that the money did not go to anyone other than NHS Charities Together and JustGiving via fees.

The charity organisers on JustGiving are called Maytrix. The people who own or set up Maytrix are Captain Tom’s daughter and son in law.
","A number of Facebook posts, shared hundreds of times each, share images of a WhatsApp message that makes a number of claims about the well-publicised fundraiser Captain Tom Moore is doing for NHS Charities Together. It makes claims about the amount of money the “charity organisers” are taking, and alleges that Captain Tom’s family benefits from the money raised. This is incorrect. It is correct that JustGiving keeps a percentage of the money raised through donations which goes towards service fees and operating costs. The figure given in the message may have been roughly accurate when the posts were published, and is now probably an underestimate. JustGiving told us that over 97% of the money raised goes to charity. We’ve written more about that here. JustGiving also told us that the Maytrix Group, the company run by Captain Tom’s daughter and son-in-law, does not receive any money from the fundraiser.   “Captain Tom and his charity walk has raised 15.5 million with over 750,000 people donating” The amount raised has now far exceeded that. At the time of writing, over £31 million has been donated to Captain Tom’s fundraiser by over 1.3 million supporters, in aid of NHS Charities Together. Donations were at £15 million on 16 April. These figures don’t include Gift Aid that could be claimed back and which currently amounts to an additional £6 million. Gift Aid allows charities to boost the value of donations from taxpayers by 25%. It essentially means that cash donations are treated as having been tax free, allowing charities to claim back the tax from HMRC.   “for every donation the charity organisers take 1.98% off the fee plus 20p per each donation” It’s slightly unclear what is meant here by the “charity organisers”. As we’ve said before, JustGiving charges payment processing fees for card or Paypal payments, which is 1.9% of the donation plus 20p. JustGiving says this charge “accounts for the varying costs of processing different payment types”. Donations made in another currency have a processing fee of 2.9% of the donation plus 20p.  JustGiving also told us it keeps around 1% of the total donations to cover operating costs, though it was not able to give an exact figure for this as donations keep rising. The platform has donated £100,000 to the fundraiser.   “then if you request gift aid they take 5% of the gift aid before passing it on” As we’ve also said before, if a donor adds Gift Aid onto their donation, JustGiving deducts a 5% Gift Aid processing service fee. This is collected separately from the donations made. At the time of writing, almost £6 million in Gift Aid had been collected (meaning a 5% processing fee would come to almost £300,000).   “so in total the charity organisers have made £600,000, not bad eh.. from what I can gather the charity organisers on just giving I believe are called maytrix.. oh the people who own/set up matrix is only captain toms daughter and son in law” The £600,000 estimate for fees taken by JustGiving may have been in the right ballpark when the Facebook posts were published, but the real total is  now likely higher than this as the total raised has also increased. Captain Tom’s daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, did help her father set up the fundraiser. She is also, along with her husband, the director of a company called the Maytrix Group. Speaking on LBC Radio, Ms Ingram-Moore also said that her company was initially sponsoring Captain Tom £1 per length he walked. Maytrix receives no money from Captain Tom’s fundraiser. A spokesperson for JustGiving confirmed to us that none of the money goes to the Maytrix Group and that the money did not go to anyone other than NHS Charities Together and JustGiving via fees.     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as partly false        because while JustGiving does charge a service fee and the fundraiser was set up by Captain Tom’s daughter, her company receives no money from it.

While Captain Tom’s daughter did help him set up his fundraiser, and along with her husband is a director of the Maytrix Group, the company receives no money from the fundraiser.

14 million people are in poverty, which is a record high.
","“Britain's shame as poverty skyrockets with children and pensioners worst hit” The Mirror, 7 February 2020 “About 14m struggling to make ends meet—a record high, says Joseph Rowntree Foundation” “The proportion of people with a job who live in poverty went up for the third consecutive year in 2018 to a record high” The Guardian, 7 February 2020 Several newspapers have reported on findings from a new report about poverty from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The Mirror said that there has been a substantial increase in poverty in the UK, and the Guardian and the Telegraph claimed poverty was at a record high. The Guardian also said that poverty rates for people in-work has risen for the last three years. None of these claims are correct. In fact the Joseph Rowntree Foundation concluded that “there has been little change in overall poverty levels for more than 15 years” (see page 5). In its report, poverty is defined as households with incomes below 60% of the median income for that financial year, after housing costs. The median is the income which would be in the middle if you lined everyone in the country’s incomes up from highest to lowest. This 60% threshold amounted to around £262 per week in 2017/18. This is just one of many ways to measure poverty. Based on this definition, it is estimated that 14 million people in the UK lived in poverty in 2017/18: approximately 22% of the population. Whilst this number is one of the highest in the last 20 years, it is the same as 2015/2016 and lower than 2016/17. The poverty rate, which accounts for the rising number of people in the UK, has stayed between 21% and 22% since 2002/03. However, the groups of people that make up those in poverty has changed. Poverty rates for pensioners have risen recently (see page 19 of the report). And working-age parents and children saw increasing poverty rates between 2012/13 and 2016/17 before slight falls in the most recent data. In contrast, working-age people without children have seen decreasing poverty rates. Overall, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report that 13% of people in work lived in poverty in 2017/18, which was a slight fall from the year before (see page 31 of the report). We spoke to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who agreed that this figure had not risen for the last three years, but also stated that “what is a record high is the proportion of families in poverty with a job”. Of all people living in poverty, 56% are in a working family compared to 39% of those in poverty 20 years ago.","
 
This is incorrect. In 2017/18, 14 million people were in poverty according to one definition. This was a fall on the previous year in terms of the number of people and percentage of the population.

The government’s own research says that Boris Johnson’s Brexit proposals would lead to a 6.4% drop in real wages.
","“The Government's own research says that Boris Johnson's Brexit proposals would lead to a 6.7% drop in GDP and 6.4% drop in real wages - the kind of hit to the economy experienced in the financial crash.”  Chuka Umunna, 18 October 2019 Mr Umunna was referencing economic analyses published by the government in November 2018, which modelled the economic outcomes under different Brexit scenarios. But he’s wrong to say GDP and real wages would “drop” according to this analysis and his comparison to the financial crash is misleading. The government estimated that a hypothetical free-trade agreement (FTA) with the EU where we maintained tariff-free access but there were still non-tariff costs (such as regulatory barriers) would cost the UK between 4.9% and 6.7% GDP growth after 15 years.  GDP (or Gross Domestic Product) is the total value of everything that happens within a country’s economy—the goods and services made and the money earned. It’s the main way economists measure how well the economy is doing. The FTA scenario is the most likely scenario following the deal agreed by Boris Johnson’s government and the EU, though the details of the trade deal would not be agreed for a while yet, so this is all still hypothetical.  However, that aside, it’s incorrect to claim the analysis said that the proposals would lead to a 6.7% drop to GDP, as Mr Umunna said. The analysis said that GDP would be up to 6.7% lower after 15 years than it would have been compared to remaining in the EU. The document said “in all scenarios the economy would be expected to grow.” It’s worth mentioning that the 6.7% figure assumed that the net migration from the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) to the UK would fall to zero—in other words the number of EU immigrants coming to the UK would be balanced by the number emigrating abroad. Other estimates of the free-trade model with a more liberal migration policy were estimated to have a lower impact on GDP.   More recently think tank UK in a Changing Europe estimated GDP per person would be between 2.3% and 7% lower under Mr Johnson’s deal than remaining in the EU after 10 years.   Mr Umunna claimed that the scale of the impact on GDP would be comparable to the financial crash. This is an unfair comparison.  Between the first quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009, GDP fell by 6%. GDP per person fell even more, by 8.5% over that period.  But the key thing is that GDP is still expected to grow in real terms under the new withdrawal agreement. It’s unfair to compare the tangible loss in incomes and earnings over a period of 15 months during the financial crisis, with a similarly sized loss of potential earnings over a period of 15 years.   For wages, the comparison is even more problematic. Weekly wages fell, in real terms (adjusting for changes in prices) by 11.2% between the high in February 2008 and the low during March 2014. This covers wages for employees in Great Britain.  So not only is the comparison between a real cut to peoples’ wages during the financial crisis and a hypothetical loss of earnings due to Brexit, the level of financial loss is fairly different. The government estimates wages to be 6.4% lower over a fifteen year period. During the financial crisis and its aftermath, wages fell by 11.2% over six years. The new withdrawal agreement is seen to be a “harder” Brexit than that negotiated under Theresa May. As such, economists estimate the impact on the economy to be greater.  UK in a Changing Europe modelled the impact of Theresa May’s deal, Boris Johnson’s deal and a no deal “WTO” Brexit.  It estimated that, after ten years, GDP per person would be around £1,500 less under May’s deal, £2,000 less under Johnson’s deal and £2,500 less under no deal, compared to staying within the EU.  Its analysis took into account two things: the expected direct impact of Brexit on trade volumes and the cost of doing trade, and the knock-on impact that trade can have on productivity (which accounted for most of the costs). As mentioned before, these estimates don’t necessarily mean that people will be worse off by £2,500 in ten years than they are now. They estimate people will be less well off by that much than if we had remained in the EU. Economic forecasts over such long periods and where the details of what might happen in the future are unknown must be taken with a large pinch of salt.   As UK in a Changing Europe says: “As we have emphasised throughout, these estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, for two reasons. “First, there is inherent uncertainty associated with forecasting the impact of economic policy choices.  “Second, there is also political uncertainty as to what those future policy choices will be, both on the part of the UK and the EU.  “Nevertheless, it should be clear that under any plausible scenario the costs associated with Brexit’s potential economic effects are much larger than the savings from reduced contributions to the EU budget.”","
 
The government estimated a free trade agreement Brexit could lead to real wages being 6.4% lower after 15 years than if the UK remained in the EU. That’s not the same as saying this form of Brexit will lead to a drop in real wages compared to now.

The government estimated that a hypothetical free-trade agreement (FTA) with the EU where we maintained tariff-free access but there were still non-tariff costs (such as regulatory barriers) would cost the UK between 4.9% and 6.7% GDP growth after 15 years.  GDP (or Gross Domestic Product) is the total value of everything that happens within a country’s economy—the goods and services made and the money earned. It’s the main way economists measure how well the economy is doing. The FTA scenario is the most likely scenario following the deal agreed by Boris Johnson’s government and the EU, though the details of the trade deal would not be agreed for a while yet, so this is all still hypothetical.  However, that aside, it’s incorrect to claim the analysis said that the proposals would lead to a 6.7% drop to GDP, as Mr Umunna said. The analysis said that GDP would be up to 6.7% lower after 15 years than it would have been compared to remaining in the EU. The document said “in all scenarios the economy would be expected to grow.” It’s worth mentioning that the 6.7% figure assumed that the net migration from the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) to the UK would fall to zero—in other words the number of EU immigrants coming to the UK would be balanced by the number emigrating abroad. Other estimates of the free-trade model with a more liberal migration policy were estimated to have a lower impact on GDP.   More recently think tank UK in a Changing Europe estimated GDP per person would be between 2.3% and 7% lower under Mr Johnson’s deal than remaining in the EU after 10 years.   Mr Umunna claimed that the scale of the impact on GDP would be comparable to the financial crash. This is an unfair comparison.  Between the first quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009, GDP fell by 6%. GDP per person fell even more, by 8.5% over that period.  But the key thing is that GDP is still expected to grow in real terms under the new withdrawal agreement. It’s unfair to compare the tangible loss in incomes and earnings over a period of 15 months during the financial crisis, with a similarly sized loss of potential earnings over a period of 15 years.   For wages, the comparison is even more problematic. Weekly wages fell, in real terms (adjusting for changes in prices) by 11.2% between the high in February 2008 and the low during March 2014. This covers wages for employees in Great Britain.  So not only is the comparison between a real cut to peoples’ wages during the financial crisis and a hypothetical loss of earnings due to Brexit, the level of financial loss is fairly different. The government estimates wages to be 6.4% lower over a fifteen year period. During the financial crisis and its aftermath, wages fell by 11.2% over six years. The new withdrawal agreement is seen to be a “harder” Brexit than that negotiated under Theresa May. As such, economists estimate the impact on the economy to be greater.  UK in a Changing Europe modelled the impact of Theresa May’s deal, Boris Johnson’s deal and a no deal “WTO” Brexit.  It estimated that, after ten years, GDP per person would be around £1,500 less under May’s deal, £2,000 less under Johnson’s deal and £2,500 less under no deal, compared to staying within the EU.  Its analysis took into account two things: the expected direct impact of Brexit on trade volumes and the cost of doing trade, and the knock-on impact that trade can have on productivity (which accounted for most of the costs). As mentioned before, these estimates don’t necessarily mean that people will be worse off by £2,500 in ten years than they are now. They estimate people will be less well off by that much than if we had remained in the EU. Economic forecasts over such long periods and where the details of what might happen in the future are unknown must be taken with a large pinch of salt.   As UK in a Changing Europe says: “As we have emphasised throughout, these estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, for two reasons. “First, there is inherent uncertainty associated with forecasting the impact of economic policy choices.  “Second, there is also political uncertainty as to what those future policy choices will be, both on the part of the UK and the EU.  “Nevertheless, it should be clear that under any plausible scenario the costs associated with Brexit’s potential economic effects are much larger than the savings from reduced contributions to the EU budget.”","
 
This is an unfair comparison as it equates real drops in GDP and wages during the financial crisis to the loss of potential earnings over longer time periods as a result of Brexit.

Once the UK leaves the single market, freedom of movement no longer applies.
","“Once we come out of the single market freedom of movement falls.”Diane Abbott MP, 19 February 2020 “Norway’s not in the single market and yet they have free movement.”Kay Burley, 19 February 2020 Asked on Sky News if a future Labour government would reintroduce the free movement of people between the UK and the EU, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said: “Once we come out of the single market, freedom of movement falls.” Presenter Kay Burley responded by saying, “Norway’s not in the single market and yet they have free movement.” Ms Abbott was correct on her point. But Ms Burley was incorrect to say that Norway is not in the single market. It is their place in the single market that means they follow freedom of movement rules. What is the single market? The single market refers the trading area in the EU. EU states are members and have to follow all the market’s rules, principally the free movement of goods, people, services and capital. In addition, members of the European Economic Area (EEA) align their rules to the single market and so are essentially part of it. This includes Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020, but remains a member of the single market during the transition period. Is Norway in the single market? Norway is part of the single market, which is why it follows the four freedoms. Ms Burley was wrong to suggest otherwise. Later in the interview, Ms Burley seemed to correct herself by saying, “Norway are not in the European Union, as I’ve said, and they have free movement of people.” This statement is true. Norway is not in the EU. It is only in the single market. Brexit with free movement Ms Abbott is correct to say that once the UK leaves the single market, freedom of movement no longer applies. After Ms Burley corrects herself and suggests she has been referring to the EU, and not the single market, all along, Ms Abbott then changes her previously correct statement, saying “once we actually leave the EU, freedom of movement falls.” This is technically incorrect. The UK has already left the EU and still has freedom of movement. The UK could also keep free movement of people with the EU after the end of the transition period, as part of a future trade deal with the EU. However this is not and has never been the government’s plan. It would require the UK to negotiate with the EU to stay in the single market.","
 
Correct. Freedom of movement is one of the rules of the single market.

Lawyers have repeatedly said that there is no legal obligation for the UK to pay to leave the EU.
","   The pub chain JD Wetherspoon has recently distributed beer mats in its pubs making a number of claims about the EU and outlining what Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin thinks the UK government’s Brexit policy should be. These beer mats have also been the subject of a number of news articles. We were asked by Full Fact readers to see if these claims stack up. The initial claim - that 'Free Trade' and 'No Deal' mean the same thing - is misleading. Exiting the EU without a deal wouldn't necessarily mean that the UK would adopt a particular trade policy afterwards; it would mean that the government would have the option to adopt it, within the constraints of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. There have been calls for the UK in a no-deal scenario to follow the lead of countries like Singapore to operate with few, if any, import tariffs. However, this is not currently government policy, and it's also possible that the government could choose to raise import duties following a no-deal Brexit. The UK government is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU, and the shape of the UK and the EU’s future relationship. The UK's aims include what it calls a “deep and comprehensive economic partnership”, with the EU, including establishing a “free trade area for goods”.  At the moment, the UK is part of the EU Customs Union. This means we can’t face or impose tariffs (which are like taxes) on our trade with other countries in the customs union. The EU does set some tariffs on trade that comes in from the rest of the world, outside the customs union, which means some UK imports face tariffs too. That’s unless the EU has a specific trade agreement with the countries involved. It also waives tariffs on most goods from almost 50 developing countries under its Everything But Arms policy.  If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal in place we would trade with the EU under the rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation: an international body which regulates world trade. This is what people mean by trading “under WTO terms” or a “no deal Brexit”. This means the UK could remove tariffs on some goods that currently face them via the EU. It’s generally accepted that reducing tariffs in and of itself lowers consumer prices: after all, these are an additional tax on products. There’s inherent uncertainty to any predictions, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has estimated that abolishing tariffs entirely could reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7–1.2%. But tariffs are just one factor that impacts on the prices that consumers actually pay.         Removing tariffs like this is only possible if the UK leaves the EU’s customs union. Doing this would likely lead to the need for new checks on goods moving between the UK and the EU, which would introduce new costs on this trade. The IFS concludes that these new costs would probably be greater than the limited savings from abolishing tariffs: leading to higher costs for consumers. The UK government has recently published a series of guidance notes explaining how people should prepare for a no-deal Brexit, giving some clarity as to what these “non-tariff barriers” would look like. The trade guidance it has published suggests that businesses might consider buying new software or hiring “a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider” to help them navigate these new requirements.  In a poll conducted by ICM on behalf of the Guardian in August 2017, respondents were asked whether they thought that “paying an ‘exit fee’ of up to £40bn … as the UK’s contribution to spending commitments made by the UK when the UK was a member” was acceptable or unacceptable. 75% said they thought it was unacceptable. Polling organisation YouGov has noted that people’s responses to this question seem to depend a lot on how the question is framed. Respondents tend to be more supportive of the lower figure in a range of options and less supportive of higher figures. In this case the £40 billion was the highest figure provided. The size of the UK’s “divorce bill” with the EU is estimated to be £35-39 billion. We’ve written more about that here. Dividing £39 billion by the population of the UK and the number of MPs does give you about “£600 for every man, woman and child in the UK — or £60 million per MP”. A House of Lords report has argued that legally the UK isn’t required to pay a penny. This has been disputed by some legal experts, and the report itself acknowledges that there are “competing interpretations”. The Institute for Government has suggested that, if the UK refused to pay the exit fee, the EU might seek redress through the International Court of Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The UK Government collects tariff revenues on goods it imports from states that don’t have tariff-free trade with the EU, and contributes this to the EU budget, after keeping 20% of this money to cover “collection costs”. The UK then receives a proportion of its contribution to the EU budget back in EU-funded projects in the UK (just less than half in 2017), though less than many other member countries.   This 93% figure seems to refer to the proportion of the world’s population that is in not in the EU, and is correct. Another way of considering this issue is the proportion of the world’s economic activity (measured in GDP) that is accounted for outside of the EU: an estimated 78% in 2016. Whether consumers would want to swap EU goods like champagne for English sparkling wine is a matter for them. This isn’t a straightforward claim, and there’s no definitive way of measuring the impact that tariff changes might have had on those countries’ economies. Nor is there an easy way of summarising how low a country’s tariffs are, because they can vary a lot. One way to compare what sort of tariffs different countries charge on their imports is to compare their average World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs. This isn’t a perfect measure of how “free” a country’s trade is, as it doesn’t take account of any preferential trade agreements that individual countries or groups of countries have negotiated. In the case of the EU, for example, most trade takes place with countries that have negotiated improvements on these WTO rates. It also doesn’t tell you anything about trade in services. This isn’t subject to tariffs, but can face other non-tariff barriers to cross-border trade. Countries have two sets of tariffs: “bound tariffs” and “Most Favoured Nation” (MFN) tariffs. The bound tariff is the “upper bound”: the amount that countries have pledged to the WTO that they won’t exceed. The MFN tariffs are the ones that are generally used, and must be applied to all WTO members a trade agreement isn’t in place with. In WTO parlance this means that all countries are treated the same as the “Most Favoured Nation”. There can be a large discrepancy between these two figures. Hong Kong is the only place in the world to remove all of its tariffs, and in general, agricultural goods are subject to higher tariffs than other goods. Switzerland’s average MFN tariff, for example, is increased by the high tariffs it applies to agricultural products: on average 35%. Singapore’s average MFN tariff is zero, but this hides two details. One is that it retains a small average tariff on beverages and tobacco: 1.6%. The other is that it has a much higher average “bound tariff” of 9.4%: the level that the country can raise its tariffs to without breaking WTO rules.  Both the USA and India have expressed interest in agreeing trade deals with the UK. These will be complex to negotiate and will require the UK government to make trade-offs. For example, in a trade deal with the US, how much would the UK want to coordinate the two countries' very different regulatory systems (the prospect of chlorine-washed chicken for sale in the UK is often raised as a concern by UK consumers)? And in a trade deal with India, would the UK want to ease immigration rules for Indian workers?    It is generally thought that new trade deals will take the UK several years, at the very least, to negotiate. The more these trade deals seek to do—for example, the more non-tariff barriers they seek to eliminate—the longer they will take. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact  ","

The more these trade deals seek to do—for example, the more non-tariff barriers they seek to eliminate—the longer they will take. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact  ","
 
Correct, though not all non-EU trade is subject to tariffs. The EU has arrangements—including trade deals—with non-EU countries that reduce or remove these tariffs.

Ending tariffs means lower prices in shops and pubs.
","   The pub chain JD Wetherspoon has recently distributed beer mats in its pubs making a number of claims about the EU and outlining what Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin thinks the UK government’s Brexit policy should be. These beer mats have also been the subject of a number of news articles. We were asked by Full Fact readers to see if these claims stack up. The initial claim - that 'Free Trade' and 'No Deal' mean the same thing - is misleading. Exiting the EU without a deal wouldn't necessarily mean that the UK would adopt a particular trade policy afterwards; it would mean that the government would have the option to adopt it, within the constraints of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. There have been calls for the UK in a no-deal scenario to follow the lead of countries like Singapore to operate with few, if any, import tariffs. However, this is not currently government policy, and it's also possible that the government could choose to raise import duties following a no-deal Brexit. The UK government is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU, and the shape of the UK and the EU’s future relationship. The UK's aims include what it calls a “deep and comprehensive economic partnership”, with the EU, including establishing a “free trade area for goods”.  At the moment, the UK is part of the EU Customs Union. This means we can’t face or impose tariffs (which are like taxes) on our trade with other countries in the customs union. The EU does set some tariffs on trade that comes in from the rest of the world, outside the customs union, which means some UK imports face tariffs too. That’s unless the EU has a specific trade agreement with the countries involved. It also waives tariffs on most goods from almost 50 developing countries under its Everything But Arms policy.  If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal in place we would trade with the EU under the rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation: an international body which regulates world trade. This is what people mean by trading “under WTO terms” or a “no deal Brexit”. This means the UK could remove tariffs on some goods that currently face them via the EU. It’s generally accepted that reducing tariffs in and of itself lowers consumer prices: after all, these are an additional tax on products. There’s inherent uncertainty to any predictions, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has estimated that abolishing tariffs entirely could reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7–1.2%. But tariffs are just one factor that impacts on the prices that consumers actually pay.         Removing tariffs like this is only possible if the UK leaves the EU’s customs union. Doing this would likely lead to the need for new checks on goods moving between the UK and the EU, which would introduce new costs on this trade. The IFS concludes that these new costs would probably be greater than the limited savings from abolishing tariffs: leading to higher costs for consumers. The UK government has recently published a series of guidance notes explaining how people should prepare for a no-deal Brexit, giving some clarity as to what these “non-tariff barriers” would look like. The trade guidance it has published suggests that businesses might consider buying new software or hiring “a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider” to help them navigate these new requirements.  In a poll conducted by ICM on behalf of the Guardian in August 2017, respondents were asked whether they thought that “paying an ‘exit fee’ of up to £40bn … as the UK’s contribution to spending commitments made by the UK when the UK was a member” was acceptable or unacceptable. 75% said they thought it was unacceptable. Polling organisation YouGov has noted that people’s responses to this question seem to depend a lot on how the question is framed. Respondents tend to be more supportive of the lower figure in a range of options and less supportive of higher figures. In this case the £40 billion was the highest figure provided. The size of the UK’s “divorce bill” with the EU is estimated to be £35-39 billion. We’ve written more about that here. Dividing £39 billion by the population of the UK and the number of MPs does give you about “£600 for every man, woman and child in the UK — or £60 million per MP”. A House of Lords report has argued that legally the UK isn’t required to pay a penny. This has been disputed by some legal experts, and the report itself acknowledges that there are “competing interpretations”. The Institute for Government has suggested that, if the UK refused to pay the exit fee, the EU might seek redress through the International Court of Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The UK Government collects tariff revenues on goods it imports from states that don’t have tariff-free trade with the EU, and contributes this to the EU budget, after keeping 20% of this money to cover “collection costs”. The UK then receives a proportion of its contribution to the EU budget back in EU-funded projects in the UK (just less than half in 2017), though less than many other member countries.   This 93% figure seems to refer to the proportion of the world’s population that is in not in the EU, and is correct. Another way of considering this issue is the proportion of the world’s economic activity (measured in GDP) that is accounted for outside of the EU: an estimated 78% in 2016. Whether consumers would want to swap EU goods like champagne for English sparkling wine is a matter for them. This isn’t a straightforward claim, and there’s no definitive way of measuring the impact that tariff changes might have had on those countries’ economies. Nor is there an easy way of summarising how low a country’s tariffs are, because they can vary a lot. One way to compare what sort of tariffs different countries charge on their imports is to compare their average World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs. This isn’t a perfect measure of how “free” a country’s trade is, as it doesn’t take account of any preferential trade agreements that individual countries or groups of countries have negotiated. In the case of the EU, for example, most trade takes place with countries that have negotiated improvements on these WTO rates. It also doesn’t tell you anything about trade in services. This isn’t subject to tariffs, but can face other non-tariff barriers to cross-border trade. Countries have two sets of tariffs: “bound tariffs” and “Most Favoured Nation” (MFN) tariffs. The bound tariff is the “upper bound”: the amount that countries have pledged to the WTO that they won’t exceed. The MFN tariffs are the ones that are generally used, and must be applied to all WTO members a trade agreement isn’t in place with. In WTO parlance this means that all countries are treated the same as the “Most Favoured Nation”. There can be a large discrepancy between these two figures. Hong Kong is the only place in the world to remove all of its tariffs, and in general, agricultural goods are subject to higher tariffs than other goods. Switzerland’s average MFN tariff, for example, is increased by the high tariffs it applies to agricultural products: on average 35%. Singapore’s average MFN tariff is zero, but this hides two details. One is that it retains a small average tariff on beverages and tobacco: 1.6%. The other is that it has a much higher average “bound tariff” of 9.4%: the level that the country can raise its tariffs to without breaking WTO rules.  Both the USA and India have expressed interest in agreeing trade deals with the UK. These will be complex to negotiate and will require the UK government to make trade-offs. For example, in a trade deal with the US, how much would the UK want to coordinate the two countries' very different regulatory systems (the prospect of chlorine-washed chicken for sale in the UK is often raised as a concern by UK consumers)? And in a trade deal with India, would the UK want to ease immigration rules for Indian workers?    It is generally thought that new trade deals will take the UK several years, at the very least, to negotiate. The more these trade deals seek to do—for example, the more non-tariff barriers they seek to eliminate—the longer they will take. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact  ","
 
Not necessarily. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that a reduction in consumer prices from reducing tariffs would be wiped out by extra costs imposed by the UK leaving the EU customs union.

Correct. A proportion of this money is then spent in the UK on EU-funded projects, though less than most other EU countries.

93% of the world is not in the EU.
","   The pub chain JD Wetherspoon has recently distributed beer mats in its pubs making a number of claims about the EU and outlining what Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin thinks the UK government’s Brexit policy should be. These beer mats have also been the subject of a number of news articles. We were asked by Full Fact readers to see if these claims stack up. The initial claim - that 'Free Trade' and 'No Deal' mean the same thing - is misleading. Exiting the EU without a deal wouldn't necessarily mean that the UK would adopt a particular trade policy afterwards; it would mean that the government would have the option to adopt it, within the constraints of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. There have been calls for the UK in a no-deal scenario to follow the lead of countries like Singapore to operate with few, if any, import tariffs. However, this is not currently government policy, and it's also possible that the government could choose to raise import duties following a no-deal Brexit. The UK government is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU, and the shape of the UK and the EU’s future relationship. The UK's aims include what it calls a “deep and comprehensive economic partnership”, with the EU, including establishing a “free trade area for goods”.  At the moment, the UK is part of the EU Customs Union. This means we can’t face or impose tariffs (which are like taxes) on our trade with other countries in the customs union. The EU does set some tariffs on trade that comes in from the rest of the world, outside the customs union, which means some UK imports face tariffs too. That’s unless the EU has a specific trade agreement with the countries involved. It also waives tariffs on most goods from almost 50 developing countries under its Everything But Arms policy.  If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal in place we would trade with the EU under the rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation: an international body which regulates world trade. This is what people mean by trading “under WTO terms” or a “no deal Brexit”. This means the UK could remove tariffs on some goods that currently face them via the EU. It’s generally accepted that reducing tariffs in and of itself lowers consumer prices: after all, these are an additional tax on products. There’s inherent uncertainty to any predictions, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has estimated that abolishing tariffs entirely could reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7–1.2%. But tariffs are just one factor that impacts on the prices that consumers actually pay.         Removing tariffs like this is only possible if the UK leaves the EU’s customs union. Doing this would likely lead to the need for new checks on goods moving between the UK and the EU, which would introduce new costs on this trade. The IFS concludes that these new costs would probably be greater than the limited savings from abolishing tariffs: leading to higher costs for consumers. The UK government has recently published a series of guidance notes explaining how people should prepare for a no-deal Brexit, giving some clarity as to what these “non-tariff barriers” would look like. The trade guidance it has published suggests that businesses might consider buying new software or hiring “a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider” to help them navigate these new requirements.  In a poll conducted by ICM on behalf of the Guardian in August 2017, respondents were asked whether they thought that “paying an ‘exit fee’ of up to £40bn … as the UK’s contribution to spending commitments made by the UK when the UK was a member” was acceptable or unacceptable. 75% said they thought it was unacceptable. Polling organisation YouGov has noted that people’s responses to this question seem to depend a lot on how the question is framed. Respondents tend to be more supportive of the lower figure in a range of options and less supportive of higher figures. In this case the £40 billion was the highest figure provided. The size of the UK’s “divorce bill” with the EU is estimated to be £35-39 billion. We’ve written more about that here. Dividing £39 billion by the population of the UK and the number of MPs does give you about “£600 for every man, woman and child in the UK — or £60 million per MP”. A House of Lords report has argued that legally the UK isn’t required to pay a penny. This has been disputed by some legal experts, and the report itself acknowledges that there are “competing interpretations”. The Institute for Government has suggested that, if the UK refused to pay the exit fee, the EU might seek redress through the International Court of Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The UK Government collects tariff revenues on goods it imports from states that don’t have tariff-free trade with the EU, and contributes this to the EU budget, after keeping 20% of this money to cover “collection costs”. The UK then receives a proportion of its contribution to the EU budget back in EU-funded projects in the UK (just less than half in 2017), though less than many other member countries.   This 93% figure seems to refer to the proportion of the world’s population that is in not in the EU, and is correct. Another way of considering this issue is the proportion of the world’s economic activity (measured in GDP) that is accounted for outside of the EU: an estimated 78% in 2016. Whether consumers would want to swap EU goods like champagne for English sparkling wine is a matter for them. This isn’t a straightforward claim, and there’s no definitive way of measuring the impact that tariff changes might have had on those countries’ economies. Nor is there an easy way of summarising how low a country’s tariffs are, because they can vary a lot. One way to compare what sort of tariffs different countries charge on their imports is to compare their average World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs. This isn’t a perfect measure of how “free” a country’s trade is, as it doesn’t take account of any preferential trade agreements that individual countries or groups of countries have negotiated. In the case of the EU, for example, most trade takes place with countries that have negotiated improvements on these WTO rates. It also doesn’t tell you anything about trade in services. This isn’t subject to tariffs, but can face other non-tariff barriers to cross-border trade. Countries have two sets of tariffs: “bound tariffs” and “Most Favoured Nation” (MFN) tariffs. The bound tariff is the “upper bound”: the amount that countries have pledged to the WTO that they won’t exceed. The MFN tariffs are the ones that are generally used, and must be applied to all WTO members a trade agreement isn’t in place with. In WTO parlance this means that all countries are treated the same as the “Most Favoured Nation”. There can be a large discrepancy between these two figures. Hong Kong is the only place in the world to remove all of its tariffs, and in general, agricultural goods are subject to higher tariffs than other goods. Switzerland’s average MFN tariff, for example, is increased by the high tariffs it applies to agricultural products: on average 35%. Singapore’s average MFN tariff is zero, but this hides two details. One is that it retains a small average tariff on beverages and tobacco: 1.6%. The other is that it has a much higher average “bound tariff” of 9.4%: the level that the country can raise its tariffs to without breaking WTO rules.  Both the USA and India have expressed interest in agreeing trade deals with the UK. These will be complex to negotiate and will require the UK government to make trade-offs. For example, in a trade deal with the US, how much would the UK want to coordinate the two countries' very different regulatory systems (the prospect of chlorine-washed chicken for sale in the UK is often raised as a concern by UK consumers)? And in a trade deal with India, would the UK want to ease immigration rules for Indian workers?    It is generally thought that new trade deals will take the UK several years, at the very least, to negotiate. The more these trade deals seek to do—for example, the more non-tariff barriers they seek to eliminate—the longer they will take. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact  ","
 
Correct, looking at the world’s population. About 78% of the world’s economic output is estimated to be outside of the EU.

Uncertain. This is a very broad claim, and it is hard to attribute the performance of any economy to one factor such as reducing tariffs.

The USA and India are keen to do trade deals with the UK.
","   The pub chain JD Wetherspoon has recently distributed beer mats in its pubs making a number of claims about the EU and outlining what Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin thinks the UK government’s Brexit policy should be. These beer mats have also been the subject of a number of news articles. We were asked by Full Fact readers to see if these claims stack up. The initial claim - that 'Free Trade' and 'No Deal' mean the same thing - is misleading. Exiting the EU without a deal wouldn't necessarily mean that the UK would adopt a particular trade policy afterwards; it would mean that the government would have the option to adopt it, within the constraints of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. There have been calls for the UK in a no-deal scenario to follow the lead of countries like Singapore to operate with few, if any, import tariffs. However, this is not currently government policy, and it's also possible that the government could choose to raise import duties following a no-deal Brexit. The UK government is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU, and the shape of the UK and the EU’s future relationship. The UK's aims include what it calls a “deep and comprehensive economic partnership”, with the EU, including establishing a “free trade area for goods”.  At the moment, the UK is part of the EU Customs Union. This means we can’t face or impose tariffs (which are like taxes) on our trade with other countries in the customs union. The EU does set some tariffs on trade that comes in from the rest of the world, outside the customs union, which means some UK imports face tariffs too. That’s unless the EU has a specific trade agreement with the countries involved. It also waives tariffs on most goods from almost 50 developing countries under its Everything But Arms policy.  If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal in place we would trade with the EU under the rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation: an international body which regulates world trade. This is what people mean by trading “under WTO terms” or a “no deal Brexit”. This means the UK could remove tariffs on some goods that currently face them via the EU. It’s generally accepted that reducing tariffs in and of itself lowers consumer prices: after all, these are an additional tax on products. There’s inherent uncertainty to any predictions, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has estimated that abolishing tariffs entirely could reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7–1.2%. But tariffs are just one factor that impacts on the prices that consumers actually pay.         Removing tariffs like this is only possible if the UK leaves the EU’s customs union. Doing this would likely lead to the need for new checks on goods moving between the UK and the EU, which would introduce new costs on this trade. The IFS concludes that these new costs would probably be greater than the limited savings from abolishing tariffs: leading to higher costs for consumers. The UK government has recently published a series of guidance notes explaining how people should prepare for a no-deal Brexit, giving some clarity as to what these “non-tariff barriers” would look like. The trade guidance it has published suggests that businesses might consider buying new software or hiring “a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider” to help them navigate these new requirements.  In a poll conducted by ICM on behalf of the Guardian in August 2017, respondents were asked whether they thought that “paying an ‘exit fee’ of up to £40bn … as the UK’s contribution to spending commitments made by the UK when the UK was a member” was acceptable or unacceptable. 75% said they thought it was unacceptable. Polling organisation YouGov has noted that people’s responses to this question seem to depend a lot on how the question is framed. Respondents tend to be more supportive of the lower figure in a range of options and less supportive of higher figures. In this case the £40 billion was the highest figure provided. The size of the UK’s “divorce bill” with the EU is estimated to be £35-39 billion. We’ve written more about that here. Dividing £39 billion by the population of the UK and the number of MPs does give you about “£600 for every man, woman and child in the UK — or £60 million per MP”. A House of Lords report has argued that legally the UK isn’t required to pay a penny. This has been disputed by some legal experts, and the report itself acknowledges that there are “competing interpretations”. The Institute for Government has suggested that, if the UK refused to pay the exit fee, the EU might seek redress through the International Court of Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The UK Government collects tariff revenues on goods it imports from states that don’t have tariff-free trade with the EU, and contributes this to the EU budget, after keeping 20% of this money to cover “collection costs”. The UK then receives a proportion of its contribution to the EU budget back in EU-funded projects in the UK (just less than half in 2017), though less than many other member countries.   This 93% figure seems to refer to the proportion of the world’s population that is in not in the EU, and is correct. Another way of considering this issue is the proportion of the world’s economic activity (measured in GDP) that is accounted for outside of the EU: an estimated 78% in 2016. Whether consumers would want to swap EU goods like champagne for English sparkling wine is a matter for them. This isn’t a straightforward claim, and there’s no definitive way of measuring the impact that tariff changes might have had on those countries’ economies. Nor is there an easy way of summarising how low a country’s tariffs are, because they can vary a lot. One way to compare what sort of tariffs different countries charge on their imports is to compare their average World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs. This isn’t a perfect measure of how “free” a country’s trade is, as it doesn’t take account of any preferential trade agreements that individual countries or groups of countries have negotiated. In the case of the EU, for example, most trade takes place with countries that have negotiated improvements on these WTO rates. It also doesn’t tell you anything about trade in services. This isn’t subject to tariffs, but can face other non-tariff barriers to cross-border trade. Countries have two sets of tariffs: “bound tariffs” and “Most Favoured Nation” (MFN) tariffs. The bound tariff is the “upper bound”: the amount that countries have pledged to the WTO that they won’t exceed. The MFN tariffs are the ones that are generally used, and must be applied to all WTO members a trade agreement isn’t in place with. In WTO parlance this means that all countries are treated the same as the “Most Favoured Nation”. There can be a large discrepancy between these two figures. Hong Kong is the only place in the world to remove all of its tariffs, and in general, agricultural goods are subject to higher tariffs than other goods. Switzerland’s average MFN tariff, for example, is increased by the high tariffs it applies to agricultural products: on average 35%. Singapore’s average MFN tariff is zero, but this hides two details. One is that it retains a small average tariff on beverages and tobacco: 1.6%. The other is that it has a much higher average “bound tariff” of 9.4%: the level that the country can raise its tariffs to without breaking WTO rules.  Both the USA and India have expressed interest in agreeing trade deals with the UK. These will be complex to negotiate and will require the UK government to make trade-offs. For example, in a trade deal with the US, how much would the UK want to coordinate the two countries' very different regulatory systems (the prospect of chlorine-washed chicken for sale in the UK is often raised as a concern by UK consumers)? And in a trade deal with India, would the UK want to ease immigration rules for Indian workers?    It is generally thought that new trade deals will take the UK several years, at the very least, to negotiate. The more these trade deals seek to do—for example, the more non-tariff barriers they seek to eliminate—the longer they will take. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact  ","

Sir John Curtice has said there is absolutely no evidence of a swing in favour of a second referendum.
","“Public opinion is clearly swinging in favour of having a people's vote.” Vince Cable, September 20 2018 “There isn’t any evidence for that… Sir John Curtice, who’s like Britain’s leading pollster,  today said there is absolutely no evidence of a swing in favour of a second referendum.” Camilla Tominey, September 20 2018 There is some evidence that public opinion has swung towards a referendum on the final Brexit deal, although there is significant disagreement between polls. It’s not right to claim that Sir John Curtice has said there’s ""absolutely no evidence"" for it - he has said the evidence is not ""consistent"". This means it is still not entirely clear what the trend is, and whether a majority of the public back a second vote. As Professor Curtice has said, the uncertainty comes from the fact that polling responses can differ significantly depending on exactly what question is asked, and what the options for a hypothetical referendum would be. Professor Sir John Curtice is a political scientist at Strathclyde University and the National Centre for Social Research, and is widely regarded as one of the UK’s leading authorities on polling (and who has become well-known thanks to his regular appearances on the BBC). We haven’t been able to find any recent comments from him that suggest “there is absolutely no evidence of a swing in favour of a second referendum”. He did tell the BBC on September 20 that “there is no consistent evidence of a shift in support for a second referendum"" - which isn’t quite the same.  ""There is no consistent evidence of a shift in support for a second referendum"" Prof John Curtice told #factcheckjoel after #politicslive guests made claims about calls for a further votehttps://t.co/iR09IQOEQt #politicslive pic.twitter.com/8DJfXbcbBY He has also repeatedly written in the past month that there is some evidence for such a swing. However, he has cautioned that different polls give very different results, and that it is unclear whether a majority of the public currently support it - hence his comment that the evidence isn't consistent. On August 28, he wrote for the What UK Thinks: EU site that “while there is some evidence that Chequers may have persuaded a few more voters of the merits of holding another ballot, we probably need more instances of the same question showing an increase in support since before the beginning of July before we can be sure that this is indeed what has happened.” Some weeks later on September 18, he wrote for the BBC: “This idea [a referendum on the final deal] has gradually become more popular - even more so in the wake of the Chequers agreement. But there may still not be a majority in favour.” And the following day he tweeted that some polls show a shift towards a second vote, but others do not:  Is support for holding #euref2 increasing as claimed today by @peoplesvote_uk? Some polls say yes - but others don't. https://t.co/jjpnWjT67E; https://t.co/pjipNWSbAh; https://t.co/dcfRycXgC6 & https://t.co/wHWH2q2y1w Public opinion over whether a second vote should be held the final deal agreed for exiting the EU is complicated by two main factors. One is how the opinion poll phrases the question, and the other is what options the hypothetical referendum would present to the voters. As Professor Curtice wrote in his August 28 post, people’s responses seem to differ depending on whether they are asked about a “second referendum”, or whether they are asked if “the public” should have a vote on the “deal”. And because different polling companies have asked different questions at different times, it is hard to say with certainty how public opinion has shifted. Polls that mention “the public” having a vote on the “deal” (such as these from Opinium and these from BMG Research) have generally been more likely to show a majority in support of the vote. Polls that use the phrase “second referendum” (such as this, also from Opinium) have generally been more likely to show a majority opposed to the vote. The other issue is that there is no consensus on what options would be included in such a referendum. It could be a two-way choice between the final deal and remaining in the EU; a two-way choice between the final deal and leaving with no deal; or a three-way choice between the final deal, no deal, or remaining. As Professor Curtice says, Remain supporters are (probably unsurprisingly) more likely to back a choice between the final deal and remaining, while Leave supporters are more likely to back a choice between the final deal and no deal. One polling company, YouGov, has consistently asked the same question at regular intervals over the past year, which gives us the best opportunity to see if there is a long-term trend. Their question is “Once the Brexit negotiations are complete and the terms of Britain's exit from the EU have been agreed, do you think there should or should not be a referendum to accept or reject them?”. The polling since April 2017 suggests that there has been a shift in favour of a second referendum - from a clear majority against a second vote a year ago, to a roughly even split in recent polls.This has to be interpreted in light of the caveats mentioned above: the phrasing of the YouGov question has generally prompted responses more opposed to a second referendum than other polling, and it still doesn’t show a clear majority in favour. Conversely, some polls that have generally shown a majority in favour of a public vote on the deal have shown a slight move in the other direction, although they still show clear majorities supporting a referendum. The only other regular poll we’re aware of that consistently showed a majority opposed to a second referendum, from Opinium, has not polled on that question since the Chequers meeting that agreed the government’s negotiating position. On the balance of the evidence, it does seem more likely than not that there has been some shift of public opinion in favour of a referendum on the final deal - but it is not consistent across different polls, depends heavily on how the question is phrased, and it’s hard to say how large the shift (if any) has been.","
 
Not quite right - Professor Curtice has said that there is some evidence of a swing, but that the evidence is not consistent.

76% think the Government are negotiating Brexit badly.
","This week Leave.eu, an organisation campaigning for Brexit, circulated figures about public sentiment towards the Chequers deal and the Government’s approach to Brexit negotiations. But these figures don’t refer to the survey’s results from general public as a whole – they are for Leave voters only. When you look at all adults across England, Scotland and Wales, according to the survey it’s still the case that more people are dissatisfied with the government’s Chequers deal than satisfied, but to a lesser extent.  Leave voters are about as dissatisfied with the government’s general negotiating approach as the general population.   The data comes from a YouGov/Times survey of a representative group of British adults on the ongoing Brexit negotiations—specifically the so-called “Chequers deal”. It found that more people are not in favour of the deal than in favour of the deal. It also found that 40% of adults in Great Britain thought the deal was too soft, 12% thought it was too hard, 13% thought the balance was right, and the remaining 35% answered “none of these” or “don’t know”.  The data in the claim which showed a majority opposing the deal looked only at the results of the people surveyed who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum. The post referred to Theresa May “pissing off most of the nation”. While it’s true that leave voters were “most” of the people who voted in the 2016 referendum, Leave voters are not “most of the nation”. In mid-2016 there were an estimated 52 million adults in the UK, of whom 17 million (34%) voted leave. So it’s inaccurate to use figures for Leave voters only to describe “most of the nation”. Leave voters are more negative about the deal than the population as a whole, and according to this survey, a majority of them (54%) would be unhappy if the Chequers deal went ahead. They’re also less likely to think the deal hit the right balance between “soft” and “hard” Brexit. Nevertheless across the population far more people appear to be unhappy   with the Chequers deal than are happy with it (no matter which way the voted in the referendum). And a large majority of those surveyed (75%) think that the government is handling Brexit negotiations either “fairly badly” or “very badly”.  As with all surveys, there is a margin of error with the data. YouGov designed the survey, to ensure the views of the people it surveyed represent the views of the public, through sampling and weighting. However there are some factors that it’s still worth bearing in mind.   This survey only covers adults in Great Britain. So the people of Northern Ireland are not represented. Northern Ireland as a whole voted for Remain (unlike Great Britain) and issues around the Irish border may mean that Northern Irish people view the Chequers deal and ongoing negotiations in a different way from the rest of the UK. Therefore excluding their views on the deal and negotiations may skew the results of the data overall. Also, there are fewer non-voters included in the survey than in the general population, it counts around 1,420 voters out of the total sample of 1,730— a turnout of 82% among all adults in Great Britain. The turnout among registered voters on the day of the EU referendum was only 72% among registered voters. Non-voters surveyed were more likely to answer “don’t know” to the survey questions. So under-representing their views may also have skewed the results away from the “don’t know” responses. YouGov told us it deliberately doesn’t include as many non-voters as were observed in the referendum for two reasons. Firstly, it expects that some of the 1,420 people saying in the survey they voted Remain or Leave, did not in fact vote. Secondly it questioned the 72% turnout figure saying incompleteness, inaccuracy and double-registration in the register mean that the turnout could have in fact been higher than 72%. Though it did say this could have improved following the move from household electoral registration to individual electoral registration in 2014. The Electoral Commission said that individual registration has improved the situation, there is the potential for further improvements to remedy these issues.  Thirdly, it said that polls struggle to contact the most politically disengaged people, and so weighting up the share of non-voters could also skew the figures by overemphasising the views of “engaged non-voters”. “Unengaged non-voters” may have different views that haven’t been captured.","

51% think the Chequers deal is not good for Britain.
","This week Leave.eu, an organisation campaigning for Brexit, circulated figures about public sentiment towards the Chequers deal and the Government’s approach to Brexit negotiations. But these figures don’t refer to the survey’s results from general public as a whole – they are for Leave voters only. When you look at all adults across England, Scotland and Wales, according to the survey it’s still the case that more people are dissatisfied with the government’s Chequers deal than satisfied, but to a lesser extent.  Leave voters are about as dissatisfied with the government’s general negotiating approach as the general population.   The data comes from a YouGov/Times survey of a representative group of British adults on the ongoing Brexit negotiations—specifically the so-called “Chequers deal”. It found that more people are not in favour of the deal than in favour of the deal. It also found that 40% of adults in Great Britain thought the deal was too soft, 12% thought it was too hard, 13% thought the balance was right, and the remaining 35% answered “none of these” or “don’t know”.  The data in the claim which showed a majority opposing the deal looked only at the results of the people surveyed who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum. The post referred to Theresa May “pissing off most of the nation”. While it’s true that leave voters were “most” of the people who voted in the 2016 referendum, Leave voters are not “most of the nation”. In mid-2016 there were an estimated 52 million adults in the UK, of whom 17 million (34%) voted leave. So it’s inaccurate to use figures for Leave voters only to describe “most of the nation”. Leave voters are more negative about the deal than the population as a whole, and according to this survey, a majority of them (54%) would be unhappy if the Chequers deal went ahead. They’re also less likely to think the deal hit the right balance between “soft” and “hard” Brexit. Nevertheless across the population far more people appear to be unhappy   with the Chequers deal than are happy with it (no matter which way the voted in the referendum). And a large majority of those surveyed (75%) think that the government is handling Brexit negotiations either “fairly badly” or “very badly”.  As with all surveys, there is a margin of error with the data. YouGov designed the survey, to ensure the views of the people it surveyed represent the views of the public, through sampling and weighting. However there are some factors that it’s still worth bearing in mind.   This survey only covers adults in Great Britain. So the people of Northern Ireland are not represented. Northern Ireland as a whole voted for Remain (unlike Great Britain) and issues around the Irish border may mean that Northern Irish people view the Chequers deal and ongoing negotiations in a different way from the rest of the UK. Therefore excluding their views on the deal and negotiations may skew the results of the data overall. Also, there are fewer non-voters included in the survey than in the general population, it counts around 1,420 voters out of the total sample of 1,730— a turnout of 82% among all adults in Great Britain. The turnout among registered voters on the day of the EU referendum was only 72% among registered voters. Non-voters surveyed were more likely to answer “don’t know” to the survey questions. So under-representing their views may also have skewed the results away from the “don’t know” responses. YouGov told us it deliberately doesn’t include as many non-voters as were observed in the referendum for two reasons. Firstly, it expects that some of the 1,420 people saying in the survey they voted Remain or Leave, did not in fact vote. Secondly it questioned the 72% turnout figure saying incompleteness, inaccuracy and double-registration in the register mean that the turnout could have in fact been higher than 72%. Though it did say this could have improved following the move from household electoral registration to individual electoral registration in 2014. The Electoral Commission said that individual registration has improved the situation, there is the potential for further improvements to remedy these issues.  Thirdly, it said that polls struggle to contact the most politically disengaged people, and so weighting up the share of non-voters could also skew the figures by overemphasising the views of “engaged non-voters”. “Unengaged non-voters” may have different views that haven’t been captured.","

Options for post-Brexit trade deals with the EU will lead to between £39 billion and £158 billion less per year.
","This graphic has been shared widely on social media. Just one tweet sharing it has received over 15,000 retweets at the time of writing. It’s based on government analysis, produced in January, of three possible post-Brexit trade scenarios with the EU (none of the three possible deals are as detailed as the government's recent white paper on the matter). The analysis compares how each deal might affect the economy. The graphic’s reporting of the analysis is highly misleading. For a start, the government report explicitly states that it’s based on hypothetical modelling and should not be used to make economic forecasts for each trade deal. This means it can’t be used—as the graphic does—to estimate the future size of GDP, or number of jobs. Even if we ignore this, most of the figures reported by the graphic are still incorrect. The GDP figures are roughly accurate, but the phrasing may be confusing—the government analysis still expects GDP to grow in each scenario, just more slowly. So “8% lower GDP” under “no deal” means GDP will still have grown, but more slowly than on the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) latest economic forecasts, over a fifteen year period. The “less per year” figures are wrong, as they refer to the how much less the economy might grow by over fifteen years, not every year. And there is no evidence for the estimated job losses they report in either the government analysis or wider research. To begin with, it’s important to clarify that the government analysis on which this graphic is based explicitly says that this is not a forecast for what will actually happen to the economy in each scenario. It’s only to give a comparative sense of each deal’s potential impact. The government uses the OBR's current economic forecasts up to 2023 (and then extrapolates them over 15 years) in order to create a baseline for economic growth. They then model three different Brexit scenarios against this baseline, and show how GDP growth varies in each one. But the report recognises that future economic uncertainty could affect the analysis, and also that it doesn’t account for short-term impacts from Brexit—so it’s not an official economic forecast for each trade deal. Although it’s not a forecast, the analysis does give an indication of the comparative impact of different trade deals. GDP is not expected to fall in any of the three Brexit scenarios, but it is expected to grow more slowly in each scenario over a 15 year period (with the caveats outlined above about the uncertain path of growth, and there being no modelling of short-term impacts). For instance, growth is expected to be around 17% over 15 years based on the no deal model, compared to 25% on the baseline model. Put another way, that’s 1.1% average growth each year in the no deal model, compared to 1.5% on the baseline. These estimates are also mid-points within quite wide ranges. This means that growth in the no deal scenario is estimated to be anywhere between 5% and 10% slower. (For the sake of clarity, this article focuses mainly on how the graphic reports the no deal scenario, but the issues with the calculations apply to all three trade deals equally.) The graphic tries to translate the different GDP growth rates into costs to the economy. This can’t be done fairly because the analysis is explicitly not an economic forecast, but even if you ignore this factor, the graphic’s estimates are still incorrect. It says that the no deal scenario will mean the economy having “£158 billion less per year”. This is actually how much less the economy might grow by over a fifteen year period, not one year. Using the 2017 GDP estimate from the Office for National Statistics, if the economy grew by 17% over the next 15 years (as the no deal model roughly estimates), by the fifteenth year GDP would be around £155 billion less than if it had grown by 25%. But in each year before that the shortfall would be less, so it’s wrong to say that this is the figure lost “per year” We don’t know what the impact of Brexit will be on jobs, but there’s no evidence in the government report to support the graphic’s calculations (which is where the makers of this graphic say their information is from). Separate research has suggested that a “pessimistic” no deal scenario could lead to significantly fewer jobs by 2030 (we haven’t verified these calculations), but it’s still nowhere near the 2.8 million figure claimed here. The graphic seems to directly translate the estimated difference in GDP growth rates in each scenario into an equivalent difference in the number of jobs. So an 8% slower GDP growth rate under no deal is equated to 8% fewer jobs, which they calculate as 2.8 million fewer jobs. (They don’t specify if this is job losses, or simply a slower increase in the rate of jobs, nor what time period this relates to.) But that’s not how the growth rates of GDP and jobs are related. 2.8 million jobs lost over 15 years, while the economy continues to grow, would be unprecedented. If the assumption is that jobs continue to rise, but by 2.8 million less, then the implication is that the rate of jobs growth and the rate of GDP growth are identical. That’s not how it works. The graph below shows that, while changes in GDP growth and job numbers generally track each other, GDP tends to rise and fall more sharply than jobs. As an illustration of how unlikely it is that GDP growth and jobs growth would exactly match each other, as this claim assumes: if jobs grew at the rate GDP is expected to grow under the baseline model, then within the next few decades there would be millions more jobs than there were adults of working age in the country (based on the ONS’s population projections). Which is pretty implausible, even if lots of people work two jobs. It should also be noted that the scenarios modelled by the government report are all quite general. They don’t have anything like the level of detail that, for instance, the government’s Brexit white paper has, in terms of the minutiae of trade agreements. Any Brexit deal we do strike will not exactly resemble the EEA-Type or FTA-Type scenarios of the report. And neither do the OBR’s forecasts, used as a baseline in the report, amount to a “remain” scenario, as the graphic suggests. The OBR forecasts are based on economic projections for the UK at present—a country which is in the process of leaving the EU, having triggered Article 50 and committed vast governmental resources to planning and negotiating Brexit—not a hypothetical scenario in which we decide to remain in the EU.","
 
This is based on government analysis comparing 3 hypothetical deals to existing GDP projections, which explicitly can’t be used as economic forecasts and are very uncertain. Were they to be used anyway, these are figures for a 15 year period, not one year.

When the UK leaves the EU, we can set our own tariffs.
","“When we leave, we can set our own tariffs. Tariffs set at the European level make food, clothing and footwear more expensive. They are the highest proportion of the poorest in society’s expenditure. If we can get rid of those tariffs, we help the worst off in society.” Jacob Rees-Mogg, 26 October 2017 It’s correct that, after leaving the EU customs union, the UK would be able to choose what tariffs—which are basically taxes on imports or exports—it puts on imports from other countries. The UK wouldn’t have a completely free hand to do this, however. At the moment, the UK can’t do this because the EU sets a Common External Tariff on anyone it doesn't have a trade deal with. Higher tariffs mean products can be more expensive after they’ve been imported. The EU sets relatively high import tariffs on agricultural products compared to everything else. The average EU tariff on agriculture was roughly 11% in 2016, compared to about 4% for other products. Tariffs on dairy products are as high as 36% on average, those on clothing can average just under 12%, and those on footwear face about 4%. Mr Rees-Mogg also claims food, drink and clothing make up the highest proportion of the poorest households’ spending. What makes up the biggest chunk depends on how you categorise different kinds of spending, but these items certainly make up a big part of what low earners spend each week. The latest figures for these are for 2015/16, from the Office for National Statistics. The lowest-earning 10% of households spend about 17% of their weekly income on food and non-alcoholic drinks. Another 4.5% goes on clothes and 4% goes on alcohol. Meanwhile a full 22% goes on housing and fuel. The highest-earning 10% are very different. They spend 7.5% on food and drink, 4% on clothes and 1.5% on alcohol. Their biggest items are transport (16%) and leisure (13.5%). So does this mean getting rid of tariffs will help the worst off? It’s likely that lower tariffs will help with the cost of certain products, but it’s also just one part of a bigger picture. Tariffs aren’t the only thing that will affect household incomes after Brexit. The value of the pound has fallen since the referendum, and that has increased pressure on food and drink prices for everyone. Despite previous inaccurate predictions (covered above), economists generally expect there to be a negative impact on the UK’s economic growth in the coming years as a result of leaving the EU. If that happens household incomes will be lower than they otherwise would have been. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","
 
Correct, although we won’t have a completely free hand to set what we want due to World Trade Organisation rules.

GP numbers are experiencing their first sustained fall for 50 years.
","“Today, we learned that GP numbers are experiencing their first sustained fall for 50 years.” Jeremy Corbyn, 8 May 2019 “There are actually more GPs in the NHS today than there were in 2015.” Theresa May, 8 May 2019 Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clashed at Prime Minister’s Questions over the number of GPs in the NHS. Both were correctly quoting their selected figures, but the problem was they were talking about two different measures. Mr Corbyn was referring to the findings of a new report by the Nuffield Trust think tank. It found that the number of fully qualified, permanent GPs across the UK, per 100,000 people, “has fallen in a sustained way for the first time since the 1960s.” The same trend is true just when looking at England in isolation. Mrs May was referring to the total number of GPs in England excluding locums. This figure went up by around 200 between September 2015 and 2018.     Both are using “headcounts” of GPs, and these figures don’t tell us anything about how many hours these GPs are working. There’s no way to account for this in Mr Corbyn’s figures as the data is limited, but it’s possible to account for this in the data Mrs May was using. Looked at this way it paints the opposite picture. The number of “full-time equivalent” GPs excluding locums fell by 330 over the same time period. Health is a devolved issue so the UK government is only responsible for services in England. Research by the Nuffield Trust found that the number of GPs per 100,000 people across the UK has fallen from a high of around 67 in 2009 to 60 in 2018. That’s a similar number of GPs per person today as there were in 2004. The last time there was a recorded drop in the number of GPs per 100,000 was in the 1960s—although the data from that time wasn’t published as regularly so we don’t have a complete picture of exactly what the numbers were doing. It fell from around 43 per 100,000 in 1964, to 42 in 1965, and just under 42 in 1970.  The figures exclude certain types of GPs: registrars (GPs in training), retainers (those on schemes to support people with a caring responsibility), and locums (GPs providing temporary cover). The Nuffield Trust also adds that its figures might underestimate the fall in GPs per person. Factors like an ageing population could mean that we need more GPs to keep up with demand. It also says the trends should be interpreted with some caution due to the fact that there are some data quality issues, figures from across the UK are not necessarily taken at the same time in every year, and the fact that in some years estimates had to be made as to the number of GPs in a small proportion of practices that didn’t report their staffing levels. There are also problems with the changing definitions of who is included in the figures over time which mean we should be cautious about comparisons. The trend is the same in England, but not in every part of the UK. In Northern Ireland the number of GPs per person has largely been rising in recent years. In Scotland, the overall number of GPs per person is higher than in the rest of the UK, but has also been falling since 2009 (though less sharply than across the UK as a whole). In Wales the trend has been largely flat in recent years.  The Department of Health and Social Care told us that Mrs May was referring to the headcount number of permanent GPs (all GPs excluding locums) in England. The number rose by 208 between September 2015 and September 2018 (the most recent comparable figures). That’s an increase of about half a percent. The trend in the number of GPs across England depends on how you count them. If you look at all GPs, including registrars and locums, the number increased by around 3,150 between September 2015 and 2018. If you exclude all registrars and locums then the number fell by 660. In other words locums and registrars are what’s increasing the number of GPs while within that picture the number of fully trained, permanent GPs is falling. Looking just at the headcount figure, or the total number of people employed in a role, doesn’t tell us much about the working capacity those people have. To do this we can look at the number of hours they all work and add these together to work out how many full-time roles they make up, known as the full-time equivalent (FTE). The number of FTE permanent GPs (the equivalent FTE measure of the type of GPs that Theresa May was counting), the number fell by 330 between September 2015 and 2018. Looking at all FTE GPs the number rose by 270 and excluding registrars and locums it fell by around 1,180. The data the Nuffield Trust based their report on only provides headcount figures, rather than FTE, as not all of the regions of the UK regularly publish data on FTE GPs.","

There are 2.1 million A&E visits a year for self-treatable conditions.
","“NHS England said there are 18 million GP appointments and 2.1 million A&E visits for self-treatable conditions a year at a cost of £850 million to the NHS.” Daily Mirror, 12 February 2018 (p.5 of print edition) “There are 18 million GP appointments and 2.1 million visits to A&E every year for conditions that could be dealt with at home, costing £850 million.” The Times, 12 February 2018 These numbers were widely reported last week, but they’re quite rough and should be treated with some caution. We can’t comment on NHS England’s medical advice, but we can say that the estimated cost savings are based on limited evidence. We only have official estimates for how many GP appointments there were in total across England in 2008, and the proportion of these that are avoidable is based on a survey of GPs that may not be representative. 2.1 million attendances at A&E in 2016/17 resulted in no treatment being given, but we don’t know if this means they could have been self-treated. NHS Digital—which publishes the figures—says it has no data on how many patients had a self-treatable ailment. The uncertainty around these figures also means that the estimate of their cost is very rough. NHS England and Public Health England have launched a campaign which encourages patients to seek advice from a pharmacist when they have a minor ailment, instead of going to a GP or accident and emergency. The campaign is particularly aimed at parents and their children. NHS England estimates that this could “help free up GP time for sicker patients and help save the NHS around £850 million each year as well as save time for busy families”, and provide patients with more convenient, timely advice, according to a press release provided to Full Fact. There were estimated to be around 300 million GP appointments across England in 2008—the latest official figures we have. A report by the Primary Care Foundation and the NHS Alliance found that 6% of GP appointments in a 2015 study could have been avoided by patients going to the pharmacy instead (roughly 2%), or caring for themselves without clinical advice (roughly 4%). This would be around 18 million of the 300 million appointments. But that figure is quite rough. It’s based on just under 60 GPs self-reporting how many patient consultations they thought could have been avoided, covering around 5,000 appointments altogether. There’s no evidence that these GP appointments were representative of the wider GP sector as a whole, nor that the they were intended to be representative. There was also a lot of variation in the proportion of appointments that different GPs thought were avoidable. The number of GP appointments is also likely to have increased a lot in the last ten years, according to expert estimates. However, they also say it’s hard to know for certain. NHS England says that 2.1 million visits to A&E were “self-treatable” in 2016/17, and told us that this referred to the number of attendances where patients were given no treatment after arriving at A&E in England. NHS Digital—which publishes the figures—told us it didn’t have any figures on whether or not an A&E attendance could have been managed through self-care.   NHS England said that fewer avoidable appointments will free up GP time for sicker patients, and help to save money. Research done by experts at the University of Kent, for NHS England and the Department of Health, found that the average cost of a GP consultation in England in 2016/17 was £31. Based on this, NHS England estimates that the 18 million self-treatable appointments in 2016/17 cost around £560 million. But the uncertainty around the number of avoidable appointments in the first place also makes this figure problematic. The average cost to the NHS in England of someone attending A&E was £148 in 2016/17, according to figures from NHS Improvement. This, multiplied by the number of A&E appointments that year where no guidance was given, comes to £310 million. This assumes this type of A&E attendance costs the same as the average. The Nuffield Trust also told us that reducing the number of GP and A&E visits might not lead to significant cost reductions. The average cost of an appointment factors in paying staff and occupying the premises, so fewer appointments won’t lead to financial savings unless resources such as the number of staff or buildings used to provide them can be reduced too.

We have limited evidence on the number of self-treatable appointments, so any cost estimate is fairly rough. How much could be saved by avoiding these appointments depends on whether the number of staff or buildings used could be reduced as a result.

Three quarters of maternity units don’t have consultants present overnight during the week.
","“Three in four labour wards have no consultants overnight. A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends.” Daily Mail, 26 October 2016 “A survey of 165 maternity units found that in 2014/2015 around 27% of labour wards have consultants physically present overnight on weekdays, falling to 15% at the weekend. Telegraph, 26 October 2016 This is correct. Around 27% of maternity units surveyed reported that they had consultants providing weekday overnight care in 2014/15. During the day 98% of units reported that they had consultants physically present. These figures are based on a census of maternity units carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Levels of care at the weekend were lower During the day at the weekend, 57% of units which responded said that they had consultants providing care. Overnight it was 15% of units. The Royal College confirmed that the other 85% of units responded that they had no weekend overnight care. However, the proportion of units reporting that they had consultants working in the unit overnight at the weekend had increased since the previous year. In 2013/14 it was reported that only 7% of units had overnight care at the weekend. These figures aren’t a direct comparison as almost all units (197) responded in 2013/14 compared to 82% (165) in 2014/15. Altogether the 165 maternity units said that they had 2,067 consultants working in them and 67% said the consultants were present for 60 hours a week or more. The Clinical Director of Women’s Services for NHS England told a committee of MPs in 2013 that obstetric units will always have at least one consultant on call at all times even if there is not a consultant physically present in the unit. There is some debate over what impact having consultants on call rather than present has on patient care. Most births take place in these units The vast majority of births in England take place in NHS obstetric units where care is led by consultants. In 2012 it was 87% according to NHS England’s National Maternity Review. However research has suggested only a quarter of women want to give birth in these units. The other options are midwifery units or birthing centres, or giving birth at home. The review also found that the stillbirth and neonatal mortality rate in England fell by 20% in the ten years between 2003 and 2013. But it also acknowledged that “these positive headline indicators, belied variation across the country in terms of the outcomes for women and babies and the quality of the services they receive.”","
 
This is correct, according to a survey by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

There are 9 million more visits to A&E since 2000.
","“This government are committed to maintaining and delivering that vital four-hour commitment to patients, but since it was announced in 2000, there are nearly 9 million more visits to our A&Es, up to 30% of which NHS England estimates do not need to be made, and the tide is continuing to rise.” Jeremy Hunt, 9 January 2017 It's correct that there have been nine million more A&E visits since 2000/01. But the research finding that up to 30% of emergency cases were of a kind that GPs regularly deal with doesn’t apply to all A&Es. The research is specific to major A&E departments. They deal with about two thirds of all A&E cases.  30% is also the higher end of the estimate. The researchers found it was somewhere between 10% and 30%. The number of yearly visits to A&E departments of all kinds increased by 9 million between 2000/01 and 2015/16. But there are three different types of A&E departments in England. Patients can go to major A&E units, the type you would normally think of when you picture someone going for emergency treatment; speciality units that deal with particular types of emergency, such as dentistry; and walk-in centres that deal with more minor injuries. We don’t have figures as far back as 2000 on these separate types. But we do know that attendances at major A&E departments have gone up by 3 million since 2002/03. Attendances at specialist A&Es have risen by 88,000 since that year.  And visits to walk-in centres, which were recently introduced, have increased by more than 4 million since 2003/04. In 2010 the Primary Care Foundation found that between 10% and 30% of cases turning up in A&E were ones that were regularly seen by GPs. It’s this figure that the Department of Health told us Mr Hunt was referring to when he said 30% of A&E visits don’t need to be made. The report estimated that between 10% and 30% of A&E visits “could  be  classified as  primary  care  cases (types  that  are  regularly  seen  in  general  practice)”. In other words, they’re cases that all GPs would be comfortable with even if they didn’t have any specialism in emergency medicine. One of the report’s authors told us that the estimate referred specifically to major A&E units, rather than the walk-in centres or speciality units which also cater for accidents and emergencies. So it’s not right to say that up to 30% of the extra nine million A&E visits since 2000 could be dealt with by a GP, as this would include the other types of A&E including walk-in centres which are specifically for dealing with more minor ailments. At most, the finding refers to 30% of the extra 3 million visits to major A&E units. Other studies have found that some A&E patients could be dealt with in less urgent settings. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine found that around 15% of patients who attend A&E could be seen by community medical facilities if they were available within 24 hours. In 3% of recorded diagnoses in A&E’s last year “nothing abnormal was detected”. Just over 11% of those whose treatment was recorded were listed as not receiving any treatment. Patients aren’t doctors; it’s not always possible to know whether you need to go to a GP or A&E. Just because someone hasn’t received any treatment or could have been treated by a GP doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t have gone to A&E for help. The Primary Care Foundation’s report noted that the proportion of A&E patients who could be seen by a GP if one was available on the day is “much higher” than those who could be seen outside of A&E if they had to wait several days for a GP to become available. In 2013, the Royal College of Physicians told a committee of MPs that they believed there was a relationship between the availability of GP appointments and the numbers of people going to A&E. The Royal College of General Practitioners told the same committee that they questioned whether GPs had the capacity to take on more work. A study by Imperial College London found that there was a link between whether or not patients could get an appointment with their GP within two days and whether they would go to A&E instead. The authors looked at 95% of GP surgeries in England in 2010/11. But they also pointed out that other smaller studies have not found the same link and that more work needs to be done in the area. Around 85% of people report that they were able to get a GP appointment the last time they tried, according to the NHS’s GP Patient Survey. This has been decreasing since 2012, when it was around 88%.","
 
This is correct, but walk-in centres have been introduced since then, and this type of A&E has seen the biggest rise in attendances. Major A&E departments have seen their attendances increase by around 3 million between 2002/03 and 2015/16.

There are 1,000 fewer GPs now than there were when Theresa May became Prime Minister.
","“The government promised to recruit an extra 5,000 GPs by 2020, where are they? … “There are 1,000 less GPs than there were the day she became Prime Minister” Jeremy Corbyn, 20 December 2017 “We are seeing more GPs, we are seeing more training places for our GPs.” Theresa May, 20 December 2017 The number of GPs in England has almost certainly fallen since last year, but it’s difficult to put an exact number on it. Mr Corbyn’s figure of 1,000 fewer GPs uses figures that aren’t comparable, although this also means the actual fall could well be larger than this. Theresa May said during Prime Minister’s Questions that there were more GPs and more training places for GPs. It’s not clear whether she meant to say the first of these – which would be an inaccurate claim – as she appeared to correct herself straight away. Only the claim about training places appears in the parliamentary record. It’s correct that there are more training places available for GPs and more GPs in training filling those places. But we don’t know whether this will be enough to have 5,000 extra doctors in General Practice by 2020, as the government has promised. It’s not actually possible to accurately compare the number of GPs in England over a long period of time. That’s because many of the older figures are known to be inaccurate, and NHS Digital—which publishes the figures—has been making improvements to how GP numbers are recorded in recent years. The published figures on GP numbers in England do show Mr Corbyn’s drop of just over 1,000 GPs between September 2016—shortly after Mrs May entered office—and the latest figures in September 2017. That’s using a full-time-equivalent measure of staffing numbers, which takes into account the hours these staff are working. There are currently an estimated 33,300 GPs working in the English NHS on this measure. Last year, there were 34,500 on the records. But this isn’t quite comparing like-with-like. The main reason for that is because the older figures are known to undercount the number of locum GPs. These are doctors who provide support where and when they’re needed. They usually cover positions temporarily at surgeries, or provide an extra pair of hands during periods of high demand. NHS Digital gets these figures from local GP practices’ records. In early 2017, NHS Digital became aware that GP practices weren’t necessarily recording all of the locum GPs who had worked for them. The result was a sharp increase in the number of recorded locum GPs in March 2017. Taking this into account might mean the recent fall in GP numbers is larger in reality than Mr Corbyn suggested. In addition, if you take locum GPs out of the equation, it’s estimated there are around 1,500 fewer GPs since September 2016. Even the recent figures aren’t perfect. NHS Digital needs to make estimates to account for GP practices it doesn’t get data from. It’s still possible that the number of locum GPs, for example, isn’t being counted as accurately as it could be. It’s also not possible to compare GP numbers now to what they were back in 2010, as there were other changes to the figures since then. Theresa May is broadly correct to say the number of GP training places is rising. So far in 2017, there have been 3,250 GP training places available in England. 3,093—or 95%—of these have been filled through the main recruitment rounds. This is the first year since 2009 to show the number accepted for training via the main routes passing 3,000. The same number of places was available last year, but only about 90% were filled then. Overall, the number of places available for GP trainees has been rising since 2011, but not all are being filled. The number of people accepted for training places faltered notably in 2014, but has been rising since then. The government’s commitment since 2015 has been to increase the number of doctors working in general practice by 5,000 by the end of the decade. It restated that commitment earlier this year. The NHS has been taking measures to try and achieve this. Along with increasing the number of training places, it’s been making recruitment drives and trying to retain more existing staff. But it’s not clear yet whether this will be enough. For a start, the government itself has expressed some concerns that a large number of GPs are retiring. When asked this summer about the recent falls in GP numbers, the Health Secretary said that: “We have had a big increase in the number of medical students choosing to go into general practice, but we have also had an increase in the number of GPs retiring early. That is a problem that we are urgently addressing.” The National Audit Office and health think-tank the King’s Fund have also said it could be difficult to achieve the target given the falling numbers of GPs currently, the shortfall in training places being filled, more people working part-time, and difficulties keeping hold of existing staff. Even with the extra number of GPs currently entering training that the Prime Minister talks about, it’s difficult to say how much they’ll eventually impact the overall GP numbers, when that will happen, and how many existing GPs will leave the profession over the next few years as well. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, told us: “We’re seeing more foundation doctors than ever before enter GP specialty training, which is fantastic, but from that point, it takes a minimum of three years before those doctors can practise independently as a GP. For one reason or another, many GP trainees take longer than three years to attain their Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT). “The number of GPs in training is a positive sign for the future workforce, but it doesn’t really tell us precisely when they will enter the profession, and it also doesn’t take into account the number of GPs leaving our profession, or those entering our profession via different routes, such as through international recruitment.”","
 
This uses figures that aren’t comparable, but it’s still almost certain that the number of GPs in England has fallen since last year, and could have fallen by over 1,000.

When asked this summer about the recent falls in GP numbers, the Health Secretary said that: “We have had a big increase in the number of medical students choosing to go into general practice, but we have also had an increase in the number of GPs retiring early. That is a problem that we are urgently addressing.” The National Audit Office and health think-tank the King’s Fund have also said it could be difficult to achieve the target given the falling numbers of GPs currently, the shortfall in training places being filled, more people working part-time, and difficulties keeping hold of existing staff. Even with the extra number of GPs currently entering training that the Prime Minister talks about, it’s difficult to say how much they’ll eventually impact the overall GP numbers, when that will happen, and how many existing GPs will leave the profession over the next few years as well. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, told us: “We’re seeing more foundation doctors than ever before enter GP specialty training, which is fantastic, but from that point, it takes a minimum of three years before those doctors can practise independently as a GP. For one reason or another, many GP trainees take longer than three years to attain their Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT). “The number of GPs in training is a positive sign for the future workforce, but it doesn’t really tell us precisely when they will enter the profession, and it also doesn’t take into account the number of GPs leaving our profession, or those entering our profession via different routes, such as through international recruitment.”","

The death rate from heart disease has increased for the first time in 50 years.
","“Shock rise in heart disease deaths — Experts call for action after rates increase for first time in 50 years” Daily Express, 13 May 2019 On Monday, the British Heart Foundation (BHF) reported that the number of under 75s in the UK dying of heart diseases and strokes had seen the first sustained increase in 50 years. The story was picked up by the Daily Express and almost every other national newspaper. But what was reported didn’t quite match the facts of the report released by the BHF. And regardless, there’s only so much this data tells us. Contrary to what most of the headlines suggest, the overall number of deaths from heart disease in the UK continues to fall, as does the rate (the number of deaths per 100,000 people, adjusted for age). The rate at which deaths have been falling has, however, slowed down significantly in recent years. There are three key things which the Express fails to make clear. Firstly, the headline suggests the total number of deaths from heart disease has increased, and the print article doesn’t clarify until the third   paragraph that the “rise” doesn’t refer to the whole UK population. Looking at people of all ages  the number of deaths from heart disease fell slightly from 152,465 to 152,405 between 2016 and 2017, according to the BHF’s data which they provided to us. The increase in deaths has been among those aged under 75: rising from 42,311 in 2016 to 42,384 in 2017. Similarly neither the Guardian, Independent, i nor BBC made this clear in their headline. Secondly, this isn’t, strictly speaking, the first rise in deaths “in 50 years”. Heart disease deaths among the under 75s have actually been rising since 2014, according to the same BHF data. The BHF calls this the first “sustained” rise in 50 years as the number has increased for three consecutive years.    So 2017 isn’t the first year the number of deaths rose, as suggested in various newspapers, but they probably weren’t helped by unclear wording from the BHF.   Thirdly, and most importantly, the Express said the rate of death has increased, when it hasn’t. Whether you’re looking at under-75s or at all ages the death rate from heart disease has continued to fall (despite the total number of deaths among under 75s) increasing. Over time the population continues to increase in size, so looking at the total number of deaths doesn’t really tell us much (as you would expect this to increase as the population gets larger). What’s more useful to look at is the age-standardised death rate, or the number of people who die from heart disease per 100,000 in the population. This figure is also adjusted to take account of the different ages of these people. For example, there are a lot more people in the UK just under the age of 75 as those born in 1947 (at the beginning of the baby boom) have reached their 70s.   Over the past 50 years the age-standardised death rate from heart disease has declined almost every year, for both the whole population, and the population aged under-75.  In fact for most of that period, the speed at which the death rate fell accelerated. For example, in 1981, the death rate was 10% lower than five years earlier. In 2011, the death rate was 26% lower than five years earlier. But from 2011 we’ve seen that trend slow down. The death rate continues to decrease, but it’s decreasing at a slower rate than it used to.    So although there’s been a slight uptick in the total number of people aged under 75 dying—which is affected by population change among other factors—there has been a “significant slowdown” in how quickly heart disease death rates are improving. ","

50% of mental health problems develop by the age of 14 and 75% by the age of 18.
","“We know that 50% of mental health problems develop before the age of 14 and that 75% develop before the age of 18."" Barbara Keeley MP, 8 March 2018 ""75% of those with a mental health condition start developing it before the age of 18"" MQ: mental health charity “50% of mental health problems are established by age 14 and 75% by age 24.” Mental Health Foundation There are a number of different claims regarding the age at which most people with a mental health condition begin to develop it. These particular claims are based on two different studies, one looking at a group of New Zealanders over the first decades of their lives and the other an American study interviewing people about when they first developed their mental health condition. This is based on a 2003 study by researchers based in Dunedin, New Zealand. It examined around 1,000 people born in the town in 1972 and 1973. The participants’ mental health was assessed in a number of ways—they were given psychiatric interviews at ages 11, 13, 15, 18, 21 and 26, it was determined whether they were accessing mental health treatment already and if they were using “intensive mental health services”. There were five categories of mental health condition identified in the study’s participants: anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance use disorders, conduct disorders and ADHD. The study found that of those participants who had a mental health condition diagnosed by the age of 26, around 230 had been first diagnosed with a mental health condition between the age of 11 and 15 (or 50%) and another 110 (or roughly 24%) were first diagnosed with a condition by age 18. Looking at adults in the group who were diagnosed with anxiety, depression and antisocial personality disorder, the authors found that “adults with these disorders had usually had the same disorder in childhood or adolescence. Our study also provided evidence that most adult disorders were preceded in childhood by a variety of diagnoses”. The authors of the study say that there are “several limitations” with the study that need to be kept in mind when interpreting the results. Firstly the group of people studied were all born in New Zealand in the 1970s and the group was largely white (91%).   They said that while the proportion of people suffering from mental health conditions was similar to other studies carried out in the USA, other studies should be carried out in other parts of the world. So while it is possible that a similar proportion of young people in the UK could experience mental health conditions at similar ages, this study alone can’t show that. The authors also say their findings that 75% of adults with a mental health condition had one before the age of 18 is likely to be an underestimate. Each interview focused on the previous year in each person’s life—but there was more than a year between each interview so some conditions or participants may not have been picked up by the study. The study only looked at mental health conditions that had developed by the age of 26, so it can’t tell us much about conditions that may not develop until later in life. The study’s authors say that “examination of the developmental history of mental disorders in older cohorts is warranted.” And finally, not all mental health conditions were considered by the study. It left out a number of conditions including somatic disorders, sexual disorders, and cognitive impairments. Another study conducted at the University of Michigan between 2001 and 2003 interviewed English-speaking Americans over the age of 18. They were asked questions in order to diagnose whether they had any mental health conditions and also to find out about any possible risk factors they had. The study looked to diagnose a number of types of conditions using similar criteria to the New Zealand study. It looked at anxiety disorders, mood disorders—like depression—conditions linked to impulse control—like ADHD—and conditions linked to substance use and abuse. Participants in the study were also asked questions to determine when their mental health condition began. Although the age at which conditions first appeared in participants varied depending on their mental health condition, when looking at all mental health conditions being examined in the study the researchers found that around 50% of conditions had developed by the time participants were age 14. 75% of conditions had developed by the time participants were 24 years-old. Researchers did say that they thought the results were “conservative”. Firstly this might be because people with mental health conditions may have been less likely to participate in the study. The results may also have been affected by participants not wanting to report “embarrassing behaviours”. The researchers also thought that the age at which participants remembered their mental health conditions starting may have been incorrect in some cases. They also point out that the study didn’t account for the severity of the mental health conditions and whether treatment would be required or available for them. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact","
 
This was the finding of a study of New Zealanders born in the early 1970s that followed them throughout their lives. The study’s authors caution that it might not apply to all countries, particularly as around 90% of those who took part in the study were white.

The number of mental health nurses has fallen from 46,155 to 39,358 [since 2009].
","“The number of hospital beds for people with acute mental health conditions, where a consultant psychiatrist is on hand to oversee treatment, has fallen by almost 30% since 2009.” “Over the same nine years, the data also show significant falls in the number of mental health nurses working in the NHS – from 46,155 to 39,358 – and in the number of doctors in specialist psychiatry training, from 3,187 in 2009 to 2,588 in the first quarter of this year.” The Observer, 21 July 2018 The number of overnight beds for those suffering with mental health issues, mental health nurses and psychiatrists in training in the NHS in England have all dropped since 2009. Using comparable figures since 2010, the average number of mental illness beds per year has dropped by 22% from 23,400 to 18,300. The 30% drop claim compares years before and after a change in the way the data was collected in 2010, which means fewer bed types are now counted. The figure used in the Observer compares 2009/10 with 2017/18, which are not comparable. NHS England said that since 2013/14, the drop may have been affected by trusts reclassifying beds so they are no longer “consultant-led”, and are instead run by “multidisciplinary teams”. This is for beds under the care of consultants, so won’t cover all beds for people suffering with a mental illness.  The number of hospital beds in general has fallen over the last 30 years, despite rising population and patient numbers, mainly because of advances in medicine. The number of mental illness overnight beds dropped by 62% in the 20 years to 2009. The King’s Fund put this decrease down to the “policy shift to providing care for people with mental health problems and learning disabilities in the community rather than in institutional settings”. The number of full-time equivalent (FTE) mental health and learning disabilities nurses dropped by 16%, or by around 7,500 between September 2009 and September 2017. The figures quoted in the claim compared the number of mental health and learning disability nurses between September 2009 and March 2018, but as the number of nurses working in the NHS in England changes throughout the year this isn’t a fair comparison. The majority of these nurses (90% in March 2018) are mental health nurses, with the rest working with patients with learning disabilities. 10% of these nurses work with people with learning disabilities and difficulties, and are included in the number of mental health nurses because of a wider definition of “mental health nurses” used by NHS Digital, which publishes the figures. Just looking at nurses working in mental health, the number has fallen by 13%, or by 5,200 between September 2009 and September 2017. Following their two foundations years of training after medical school, junior doctors can choose to specialise. There were the equivalent of around 3,200 full-time junior doctors specialising in psychiatry training in September 2009. That number had fallen by around 500, or 15% by September 2017—the most recent comparable figures. There were around 2,600 FTE junior doctors in psychiatry training in March 2018. A report from Health Education England published in 2017 said not enough newly qualified doctors were “choosing/able to train in psychiatry” and that there was a higher proportion of unfilled core psychiatry training posts than in any other speciality. It said that there were “low direct transition rates” from core psychiatry training into more specialised training and that the field relied on non-UK doctors choosing to specialise. It also said the workforce heavily relied on doctors who are neither training nor consultants, for which there isn’t “a secure supply pipeline”.

This is the difference in the number of mental health and learning disabilities nurses between two different months which isn’t the best way to compare the figures. Comparing the figures in September 2009 and 2017 shows the drop has been larger.

We have an ageing population. 
","“The challenge the health service faces is that demand on it is growing all the time. We have an ageing population, more and more people seeking treatment, the number of people going into A&E departments every year is rising up and up and up.” Chris Grayling, 19 October 2017 “The population in the UK is getting older” according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). 18% of people were aged 65 and over and 2% were aged 85 and over in 2016. The proportion of people aged 65 and over rose from 14% in 1976 and by 2046, the ONS predicts that almost 25% of the population will be over 65. In contrast the proportion of young people in the population is falling. People aged 15 and under fell from 25% of the population in 1976 to 19% in 2016. By 2046 the ONS predicts they will make up 18% of the population. 23.4m people went to Accident and Emergency in England between October 2016 and September 2017. This was 32,000 more people than the year before. 15.3 million of these people attended major A&E departments. This was around 12,000 more than the year before. The number of people going to A&E has generally been increasing in recent decades. The UK government is only responsible for the NHS in England. There is separate data for Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Correction 30 October 2017  The piece previously said ""By 2016 the ONS predicts they will make up 18% of the population."" This was amended to ""By 2046"". This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","

The number of EU nurses coming to the UK has fallen by 90% since the Brexit vote.
","“And in fact there’s been an increase in the number of EU staff in the NHS since the referendum.” Matt Hancock MP, 31 October 2018 “The number of EU nurses coming to the UK has fallen by a staggering 90% since the Brexit vote… The number of EU nationals leaving the NHS jumped by 14% in 2017… EU nationals have actually fallen as a percentage of those joining the NHS, and that’s on the government’s own figures.” Peter Stefanovic, 11 November 2018 All of the trends picked out in the above claims are broadly correct (even if some of the numbers are not quite right), but none of them tell us very much in isolation. It’s correct that the number of NHS staff working in hospitals and community health services in England who report they are from the rest of the EU has risen in the two years since June 2016. However, this has coincided with a fall in the number of staff whose nationality is unknown: so some of the increase could be down to more staff reporting their nationality. EU nationals made up the same proportion of NHS England staff (whose nationality was known) in June 2018 as they did in June 2016. It’s also correct that smaller numbers of staff from the EU have been joining the NHS since the EU referendum (and make up a smaller percentage of joiners). But we should be careful about saying that this is a consequence of the referendum result. The number of staff joining the NHS varies year on year, so it’s unclear what a “normal” level of EU citizens joining the NHS is. The level could have been abnormally high just before the referendum (so some level of drop-off after was to be expected).   “There’s been an increase in the number of EU staff in the NHS since the referendum.” The number of NHS staff working in hospitals and community health services in England who report that they are from the rest of the EU rose by around 4,400 between June 2016 (when the EU referendum was held) and June 2018. But these figures can’t tell us for certain what the actual increase in the number of staff from the EU is. That’s because there are some staff in the NHS whose nationality we don’t know (around 71,000 in June 2018)—so the data we have is missing around 6% of the workforce at the time. The number of staff whose nationality is unreported also fell by 18,000 between 2016 and 2018. So some of the rise in EU nationals could be down to more staff having their nationality recorded. The House of Commons Library says: “while it is likely that there has been an overall increase in the number of EU NHS staff since 2016, we cannot be sure about the scale of the change”. The information on staff nationality is also self-reported—so this may reflect a person’s country of birth or cultural heritage rather than their country of citizenship. One alternative is to look at the percentage of staff who report they are from the rest of the EU, based on all staff whose nationality is known. Staff from the rest of the EU made up 5.6% of NHS staff (whose nationality is known) working in hospitals and community health services in England in June 2018. That’s pretty much the same as the level in June 2016 (5.5%). “EU nationals have actually fallen as a percentage of those joining the NHS” People reporting they were from the rest of the EU made up 8% of new staff (whose nationality was known) joining the NHS in England in the year to June 2018. That compares to 11% in the year to June 2016. However to put these figures in context, it helps to look at them over a longer period of time. The number of EU nationals joining NHS England rose in the years before the EU referendum and then dropped off in the years after. The number of EU nationals who joined NHS England in 2017/18 was similar to the number 2013/14 and in both years they made up around 8% of all joiners for whom nationality was known. This means we should be careful of linking this sudden drop in EU staff joining the NHS directly to the referendum result. It could be that the number of joiners was exceptionally high in the years just before the referendum—so some level of fall may have been expected, regardless of the result. We don’t know what would have happened to EU staff numbers if there had never been an EU referendum, or if the UK had voted to remain. So we can’t say how much of the reduction, if any of it, is linked to the actual result. “The number of EU nationals leaving the NHS jumped by 14% in 2017” That’s correct, comparing the number who left in 2016 with the number who left in 2017. If you compare the number who left in the year to June 2016 with the year after it’s slightly higher—22%. Looking in the longer term, EU nationals have made up an increasingly large share of those leaving the NHS in each year since 2012/13. “The number of EU nurses coming to the UK has fallen by a staggering 90% since the Brexit vote” This seems to be based on the number of nurses from the European Economic Area (EEA) who came to the UK and registered to work. To work in the UK, nurses need to join the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s (NMC) register. People on this register can be working in the NHS (in any of the four countries in the UK), the independent sector or perhaps not even working in the profession at all. The number of EEA nurses and midwives who joined the NMC register for the first time rose in the years up to 2015/16 (just before the referendum), before falling by 91% from 2015/16 to 2017/18. EEA nurses and midwives made up 5.1% of the register in March 2018—a fall compared to March 2017, but higher than the three years before that. Looking at those who joined the NHS in England, nurses and health visitors from the EU made up 8% of new joiner nurses (for whom nationality was reported) in 2017/18, returning to 2012/13  levels after peaking at 19% in 2015/16. It does seem that nurse numbers have been particularly affected since the referendum. “Nurses and health visitors are the only staff group to record a fall in the number of recorded EU nationals since the EU referendum”, the House of Commons Library points out. Correction 23 November 2018  We amended an error in the claim/conclusion boxes at the top of this article. The third ""claim"" box mistakenly contained the wording of the fourth ""conclusion"".","

The number of staff whose nationality is unreported also fell by 18,000 between 2016 and 2018. So some of the rise in EU nationals could be down to more staff having their nationality recorded. The House of Commons Library says: “while it is likely that there has been an overall increase in the number of EU NHS staff since 2016, we cannot be sure about the scale of the change”. The information on staff nationality is also self-reported—so this may reflect a person’s country of birth or cultural heritage rather than their country of citizenship. One alternative is to look at the percentage of staff who report they are from the rest of the EU, based on all staff whose nationality is known. Staff from the rest of the EU made up 5.6% of NHS staff (whose nationality is known) working in hospitals and community health services in England in June 2018. That’s pretty much the same as the level in June 2016 (5.5%). “EU nationals have actually fallen as a percentage of those joining the NHS” People reporting they were from the rest of the EU made up 8% of new staff (whose nationality was known) joining the NHS in England in the year to June 2018. That compares to 11% in the year to June 2016. However to put these figures in context, it helps to look at them over a longer period of time. The number of EU nationals joining NHS England rose in the years before the EU referendum and then dropped off in the years after. The number of EU nationals who joined NHS England in 2017/18 was similar to the number 2013/14 and in both years they made up around 8% of all joiners for whom nationality was known. This means we should be careful of linking this sudden drop in EU staff joining the NHS directly to the referendum result. It could be that the number of joiners was exceptionally high in the years just before the referendum—so some level of fall may have been expected, regardless of the result. We don’t know what would have happened to EU staff numbers if there had never been an EU referendum, or if the UK had voted to remain. So we can’t say how much of the reduction, if any of it, is linked to the actual result. “The number of EU nationals leaving the NHS jumped by 14% in 2017” That’s correct, comparing the number who left in 2016 with the number who left in 2017. If you compare the number who left in the year to June 2016 with the year after it’s slightly higher—22%. Looking in the longer term, EU nationals have made up an increasingly large share of those leaving the NHS in each year since 2012/13. “The number of EU nurses coming to the UK has fallen by a staggering 90% since the Brexit vote” This seems to be based on the number of nurses from the European Economic Area (EEA) who came to the UK and registered to work. To work in the UK, nurses need to join the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s (NMC) register. People on this register can be working in the NHS (in any of the four countries in the UK), the independent sector or perhaps not even working in the profession at all. The number of EEA nurses and midwives who joined the NMC register for the first time rose in the years up to 2015/16 (just before the referendum), before falling by 91% from 2015/16 to 2017/18. EEA nurses and midwives made up 5.1% of the register in March 2018—a fall compared to March 2017, but higher than the three years before that. Looking at those who joined the NHS in England, nurses and health visitors from the EU made up 8% of new joiner nurses (for whom nationality was reported) in 2017/18, returning to 2012/13  levels after peaking at 19% in 2015/16. It does seem that nurse numbers have been particularly affected since the referendum. “Nurses and health visitors are the only staff group to record a fall in the number of recorded EU nationals since the EU referendum”, the House of Commons Library points out. Correction 23 November 2018  We amended an error in the claim/conclusion boxes at the top of this article. The third ""claim"" box mistakenly contained the wording of the fourth ""conclusion"".","
 
EU nationals made up 8% of new staff (whose nationality was known) joining the NHS in England in the year to June 2018. That compares to 11% in the year to June 2016. It’s possible that the number in June 2016 was unusually high.

Theresa May refuses to allow the very best international doctors to come here to care for our sick.
","“We have 100,000 vacancies in our NHS yet Theresa May refuses to allow the very best international doctors to come here to care for our sick.” Jonathan Ashworth, 1 May 2018 There were around 100,000 staff vacancies in NHS trusts in England between October and December 2017, according to information from NHS Improvement. It’s based on management information and is not an official statistic, so should be treated with some caution. 90-95% of doctor and nurse vacancies are being filled by temporary staff—so it’s not the case that nobody is doing these jobs. However, there is evidence that temporary staff cost the NHS more, and NHS Employers says that the vacancies are leading to some delays in treatment. Restrictions on the number of “Tier 2” visas granted to people from outside the European Economic Area mean that some international doctors are not able to come to the UK to fill vacancies. NHS Employers says over 400 doctors have been refused a visa since December 2017. There were just over 97,000 vacancies in NHS trusts in England between October and December 2017, according to NHS Improvement (NHSI), which manages NHS trusts in England. That’s around 8% of the workforce. Around 10,000 of these vacancies were for doctors, and 35,000 were for nurses. NHS trusts include all NHS services except GP surgeries—and there were 1.1 million people employed by NHS trusts in England in the same period. This vacancy level is higher than the UK average for all jobs. From October to December 2017, there were 2.7 vacancies for every 100 filled employee jobs—the same level as for January to March 2018. In the NHSI data, there are around 9 vacancies for every 100 filled jobs. These NHSI figures are whole-time equivalent (WTE), so if two half-time jobs were vacant for example, these would only count as one WTE vacancy. This is the first year in which this NHSI data on vacancies has been recorded, and there are still some things we don’t know about how it’s put together. NHSI says that its vacancies data is “based on management information from the sector” so these aren’t official statistics. As we don’t know how this information was collected, it’s hard to know quite how reliable it is. For instance, we don’t know if the data was collected using a standardised data collection system, or if there was room for trusts to interpret “vacancy” in different ways. NHSI told us that they don’t have much information on this. The Nuffield Trust think tank told us that there are lots of different ways a vacancy can be defined. For instance the classification may, or may not, include vacancies filled by temporary staff, or those where the post is not currently being advertised. There are also official statistics on vacancies in the NHS in England, but these only look at the number of job adverts posted, rather than the number of empty jobs. The latest figures on this are for September 2017, when there were around 28,000 advertised full-time equivalent (FTE) vacancies for permanent or fixed-term jobs. Across the three months from July to September 2017 there were around 88,000 vacancies advertised. 81% of these jobs were permanent ones. But as these figures look at the number of adverts, rather than individual vacancies specifically, they can’t be used to say exactly how many empty posts there were in the NHS in England. One advert can be used to fill one vacancy or several, and NHS trusts don’t have to use the system that records these figures. So this isn’t a complete figure for vacancies, only the minimum possible number. According to the NHSI data, 95% of doctor vacancies, and 90-95% of nursing vacancies were being filled by temporary staff. These are either supplied by the NHS Staff Bank, or an agency. So many of these vacancies are actually occupied by temporary staff. Is this a problem in itself? One issue is cost. NHS Improvement notes that, while trusts underspent on agency staff by about £108 million compared to what was planned in October-December 2017, they overspent on bank staff by £664 million. The National Audit Office noted in 2014/15 that “Previous reports suggest that agency doctors routinely earn 50% more than permanent staff, and hospitals might pay up to £3,500 for a doctor to work a single shift.” There is also the question of whether the widespread use of temporary staff affects patient care. The Nuffield Trust, focusing on nurses in particular, says “relatively little” is known about this. NHS Employers says that failing to recruit doctors leads to shortages on rotas, extra costs, delays in treatment, and clinics being cancelled. Despite these vacancies, there are numerous reports that doctors being recruited from abroad have been denied visas by the Home Office. NHS Employers says it has heard that, since December 2017 “at least 400 doctors who we’ve being trying to recruit to come and work within the NHS in England haven’t been able to enter the country and take up posts.” This is happening because of a cap on the number of Tier 2 visas being granted by the government. That’s the type of visa which doctors from countries outside the European Economic Area normally need in order to work here. Around 1,300 Tier 2 visas were granted in March 2018, and around 2,200 in April 2018. In January, the government estimated that a third of Tier 2 visas went to the NHS. Priority is given to visa applicants for jobs where there is considered to be a “shortage” in the UK. Nurses, and some doctor roles, are on the “shortage occupation list”. Because visa applications are oversubscribed, the minimum salary level needed to get a visa for non-shortage occupations is inflated. Without oversubscription it would be £30,000 (in most cases), but in March it was £60,000, and in April it was £50,000. Some, but not all, doctors earn that much. We’ve written more about how salary thresholds are calculated and set here. NHS Employers says that the biggest NHS shortages are among nurses. Because nurses are a shortage occupation, they get Tier 2 visas as a priority—but that means the NHS has “fewer work permits available for doctors” who aren’t in a shortage role. NHS Employers argues that applicants for shortage occupations shouldn’t be included in the cap on Tier 2 visas, which would free up more visas for doctors in non-shortage roles.","
 
The government limits the number of Tier 2 visas it grants each month. These are what non-EEA medical staff need to work in the UK. Nurses get priority access to these visas, but there are reports of some doctors being refused them due to government caps.

Health visitor numbers peaked in October 2015 at 10,309. Numbers have fallen by 2,065 or 20% since then.
","“There were 8,244 full time equivalent health visitors working in the NHS as of December 2017, which is the lowest number since August 2013. Numbers peaked at 10,309 in October 2015, meaning there has been a fall of more than 2,065 health visitors or 20% in just over two years”. Labour Party, 19 April 2018 It’s correct there were the equivalent of over 8,200 health visitors working full-time in the NHS in England as of December 2017. It’s also correct that that’s a fall of more than 2,000 health visitors since October 2015. Since NHS workforce numbers tend to vary according to the season, we usually need to compare the same month in each year to see more clearly what the change has been. In this case though the figures are roughly the same when we compare to December 2015. In December 2009 there were just over 8,000 health visitors, and that level remained fairly constant until December 2013, when it started to rise. At around the peak in December 2015, there were about 10,200, meaning numbers have fallen by 19% since then. These numbers are all ‘full-time equivalent’. Full-time equivalent is the number of staff there would be if you added together all their hours to create only full-time jobs. So for example two people working half a week each would add up to one full-time equivalent job.  Health visitors are specially qualified nurses and midwives who work with the community. They mainly work with very young children and their families. They also work with at-risk groups like homeless people, those with addictions and travellers. Responsibility for the commissioning of health visiting services was moved from NHS England to local authorities in 2015. The health think tank King’s Fund has commented on recent dips in the number of nurses and health visitors combined. It says that “The key factor in the fall” is the lower number of nurses from the EU joining the UK nursing register, and an increase in EU staff leaving the NHS. They also note more staff leaving as a result of ill-health and for reasons of work-life balance.","
 
Correct, for the NHS in England.

There are now more nurses from the European Union going home than coming to the UK.
","“If you look at the numbers, it would appear that the big change over the last couple of years has been that we've now got European Union nurses going home rather than coming here… It would seem that part of that apparently, I can't quite believe this, was some new language test was introduced which actually did mean that some people who would otherwise have got in couldn’t get in.” Howard Davies, 18 January 2018 The number of nurses and health visitors from the rest of the EU leaving posts in the English NHS outweighed the number joining in the year to September 2017, the first time this had happened in at least the last five years. Almost 2,800 nurses and health visitors, from the rest of the EU, joined the NHS and just under 4,000 left. These are headcount figures and count the number of individuals rather than full-time equivalent figures which would give an indication of the hours these staff worked. These figures don’t tell us anything about why these nurses left the NHS and we can’t say whether or not they left the UK altogether. They also include staff who may only leave temporarily, for instance those on a career break or maternity leave. The information about where a staff member is from is self-reported—meaning that it could refer to their country of birth, their citizenship or their cultural heritage. Although we can’t say anything about the reasons why these particular EU nurses left the NHS, we do know something about the reasons why nurses (of all nationalities) left in the year to June 2017. Around 49% of these nurses resigned voluntarily and of these about half said it was because they were ‘relocating’—although there are no details on where they went. For most of the other 51% of nurses, we don’t even know their reason for leaving. The number of nurses and health visitors reporting UK nationality leaving the NHS in England has outweighed the number of those joining in each year since September 2013. But there have been more nurses and health visitors from the rest of the world joining the NHS than leaving it since September 2015. Since January 2016 all nurses applying to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) from the EU have been required to sit an English language test. In order to practice in the UK a nurse or midwife must be registered with the NMC. Nurses from the EU or European Economic Area (EEA) must have reached a certain score in the required English language tests to register with the NMC, this can be either the International English Language Test System (IELTS) or the Occupational English Test (OET). Alternatively they can register if their nursing qualification was undertaken and examined in English or they have worked for at least one year in a country where English is the first language and were assessed on their English there. These alternative options and the OET test were introduced in November last year. The same English language requirements must also be provided by nurses from outside the EU/EEA when they register with the NMC. Versions of these requirements have been in place since 2005. Health think tank, the King’s Fund, cites the introduction of the new English language test as one possible reason for the sharp reduction in the number of nurses from the EU joining the NMC register, along with the result of the EU referendum in 2016. It says “This fall is not driven solely by the vote itself (new English language requirements were also introduced in 2016 for example), but just as with the Francis report, the timing is hard to ignore.” The Royal College of Nursing has said that evidence suggests “the challenge facing international recruitment in the UK stems in part from a weakening of the overall EEA supply, which is being driven by complex factors including Brexit, worsening conditions for the UK nursing workforce as well as improved economic prospects in the EEA. While IELTS may not be helping this situation, it is unlikely to be the root cause.” Correction 30 January 2018  We corrected this article to clarify that it related to the NHS in England.

In the year to September 2017 the number of nurses from the EU leaving the NHS in England outweighed those joining it for the first time in at least five years. We don’t know if they left the UK or what jobs they went on to do.

This correctly reports the government’s official figures on the number of people who were hospitalised in the UK, tested positive for coronavirus and have now died.  The actual number of people who’ve died with the disease will be larger, as deaths outside of NHS services or among people who haven’t been tested are not included. There are separate figures which can shed some light on these, but they aren’t as up-to-date. The most up-to-date figure at the time of writing shows that as of 5pm on 25 April, of those hospitalised in the UK who tested positive for the disease, 20,732 have died. As of 5pm the day before, when these posts started circulating, the number stood at 20,319, which is what the viral posts claim. As the post claims, Manchester Arena’s maximum capacity is only slightly more than this, at 21,000, although the venue’s website says it “holds around 15,500 on a normal concert”. The image in the post does appear to be of Manchester Arena. It’s important to remember that these deaths are what the government calls Covid-19 associated deaths in hospitals, and we don’t know what exactly these people died of, just that they had tested positive for the disease when they died. The government says that “Deaths of people who have tested positively for COVID-19 could in some cases be due to a different cause.” The Office for National Statistics releases data weekly on the provisional number of deaths “involving the coronavirus” in England and Wales, which includes breaking down the figures by where they happened (such as hospitals, home, care home, etc). The post also correctly says that there were 51 days between the first death of a patient who tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK, and the total of 20,319 deaths.      This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as true        because the number of people who died in hospital having tested positive for Covid-19 is around the same as the capacity of the Manchester Arena.    ","
 
Correct. The first patient who died having tested positive for Covid-19 was announced on 5 March. The total deaths was 20,319 on 24 April.

Violent incidents rose to 31,025, up 16%, of which 9,003 were on staff, which is up by a quarter in the year to March 2018.
","“More than 46,850 self-harm incidents were recorded in the year to March 2018, up by 16 per cent on the previous year, with self-harm now recorded on average 128 times a day.” “Violent incidents meanwhile rose to 31,025, up 16 per cent, and of which 9,003 were assaults on staff – a figure that has soared by more than a quarter (26 per cent) in the 12 months to March.” The Independent, 26 July 2018 “The amount of times drugs were found in prisons across England and Wales rose by 23% in one year, Ministry of Justice figures reveal…” “The figures for the year between March 2017 and March 2018 also reveal that 20.4% of drug tests came back as positive.” Sky News, 26 July 2018 Assaults of all types and self-harm incidents are up in prisons, as are positive drug tests, and the number of times drugs have been found. There were just under 83,000 people in prisons in England and Wales at the start of August 2018. The Ministry of Justice aims to randomly drug test 5% or 10% of prisoners in each prison every month. Around 54,400 tests were administered in 2017/18. 11% of the results proved positive for “traditional drugs”, like cannabis, opiates, cocaine and methadone. Positive tests for traditional drugs have risen slightly from 9% in 2016/17. This latest year had the highest proportion of positive results since 2004/5 when 11.8% were positive.  If you include positive results for psychoactive substances, like ‘Spice’, 20% of them were positive. This is the first year the psychoactive test results have been published so we can’t compare that 20% figure over time. The most common positive test result in 2017/18 was for psychoactive substances—60% of positive samples contained them. Second was cannabis, at 28%. Some test results were positive for multiple substances. The random drug tests are mandatory—although a prisoner can refuse to take it and face a disciplinary procedure. Failing the test is a disciplinary offence, which could mean a longer sentence. The number of times drugs have been found in prisons has increased over the last five years. There were 13,100 incidents where drugs were found in prisons in 2017/18, up 23% on the year before when there were around 10,700. That figure’s been increasing since 2012/13 when drugs were found just under 4,300 times. Psychoactive substances were also the type of drug found most often. There were 31,000 assault incidents in prisons and state-run immigration removal centres in the year to March 2018. 22,400 of these were prisoner-on-prisoner assaults and 9,000 were assaults on staff. There were 364 total assaults per thousand prisoners in 2017/18. That’s roughly the same as the number per thousand male prisoners, though for women (who make up about 5% of the prison population) it’s slightly lower. There were 46 per thousand prisoners, of what the Ministry of Justice classes as “serious assaults”. This includes sexual assault, anything that results in being an inpatient at a hospital, concussion and other specific types of injury like broken noses and lost teeth. For prisoner-on-prisoner assaults, there were 262 per thousand, and 106 assaults on staff per thousand prisoners.  The Ministry of Justice changed how assaults were recorded in April 2017. It said this simplified how incidents involving staff are identified but it “is possible this has increased the recording of incidents”. There were 46,900 incidents of self-harm recorded in prisons in England and Wales in 2017/18, up 16% on the year before. Per day, that works out as 128 incidents. This is the highest it’s been over the last ten years, when this data series began. Self-harm is defined as “any act where a prisoner deliberately harms themselves, irrespective of the method, intent or severity of any injury”. The figures may include some but not necessarily all attempts at suicide. There were around 11,900 “self-harming individuals” in prisons overall. Again, looking at incidents per thousand there were 549 incidents of self-harm per thousand prisoners in 2017/18 in prisons overall. Female prisoners have long been more likely to self-harm, and more often than those in male prisoners. There were 467 self-harm incidents per thousand male prisoners in 2017/18. For women, this figures was just over 2,200. There were 308 self-harming women per thousand female prisoners in 2017/18. ","
 
Correct. Assaults on staff were up a quarter from around 7,160 to 9,000.

One offender carried out 93 crimes last year before going to jail for the first time.
","“Criminals sent to jail only after 55 offences” “93: The number of crimes one offender carried out last year before going to jail for the first time” i news (print edition), 20 February 2020 i news has reported on the number of offences previously committed by people in prison in England and Wales. Whilst the numbers are mostly correct, some clarity is needed around the statements made. Notably, these numbers refer to offences, which shouldn’t be conflated with convictions. Several offences may be included in one conviction or caution, although we do not know how many from this data. The headline of the print edition of this article (which differs from the online version) reads “criminals sent to jail only after 55 offences”. This appears to suggest that, on average, criminals in England and Wales commit 55 offences before being sent to jail and that they weren’t imprisoned for any of the previous 54 offences. This is misleading for a number of reasons. The 55 offences figure referred to by i news is roughly the average number of offences previously committed by people imprisoned for up to six months in 2018/19, regardless of the outcome of those previous offences. They may have received a conviction —which could lead to prison sentence—or a caution. The FOI data i news uses in the article shows that women given a prison sentence of up to six months had committed, on average, 60.5 previous offences and men had committed 56.6 offences. For people sentenced for longer periods, the number of previous offences was lower. For example women receiving life imprisonment had committed, on average, 18.1 prior offences. For men it was 19.9. Even just focusing on people given a sentence of up to six months, the data may overstate the prevalence of reoffending, as people may be counted more than once in the figures. For example, someone sent to prison four times over the course of a year (and whom one might expect to have a larger number of previous offences) would be counted four times in the data, compared to someone sent to prison once (who may have committed a smaller number of offences). The print edition of the article also incorrectly reports that an offender carried out 93 crimes in the last year before their first time in prison.

Incorrect. This is a typo from a claim made in 2008 which said 4 square metres not kilometres of rainforest are destroyed for every gram of cocaine. This estimate doesn’t appear to be true in 2016.

The UK is a world leader in robberies.
","“New Home Office analysis shows the UK is a world leader in... robberies.” Louise Haigh MP, 9 May 2018 “Government figures show the robbery rate shot up by 10% in a year—more [than] any of 12 other nations examined by the Home Office.” Daily Mirror, 9 May 2018 It’s correct that the number of recorded robberies in England and Wales increased by 10% from 2015 to 2016, and when factoring in population changes, the robbery rate per 100,000 people increased by 9%. Both of those increases are greater than in 12 other countries analysed by the Home Office.  Not all crimes are reported to, and recorded by the police, so these figures can only tell us so much about the true level of crime.  The UK doesn’t have more robberies, or robberies per person, than the rest of the world. The analysis by the Home Office looked at figures for England and Wales rather than the UK as crime figures are published separately for Scotland and Northern Ireland. England and Wales’s recorded reported robbery rate in 2016 was fourth highest of the countries included in the analysis, while Scotland’s robbery rate was the lowest. It’s difficult to make an exact comparison between the robbery figures in each country due to the different definitions of robbery and the way the figures are recorded in each country. Robbery is stealing or attempting to steal from a person or business using force or the threat of force. In 2015 there were around 51,000 robberies recorded by police in England and Wales, which increased to about 56,000 in 2016 (or by 10%). That’s 96 robberies per 100,000 people, a 9% increase on 2015, once you factor in the changes in population from 2015 to 2016. Since the Home Office analysis was published, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published data for 2017, showing that the number of robberies increased to about 74,000 (or by 33%) from 2016 to 2017. The ONS says that improvements in police recording may have had some impact on the rising numbers, but an actual increase in robberies may also have happened. Not all robberies are reported to the police so we can also use survey results to determine how many robberies may have happened in total in any given year. There were estimated to be 175,000 robberies (against people, these figures don’t include businesses) in 2017, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales. But because the figures are based on a survey and relatively few respondents may have experienced a robbery it’s hard to be precise. The ONS told us the figure could have been anywhere between 125,000 and 224,000 Not all countries have similar surveys measuring crimes, whether or not they’re reported, so we’ve not compared these figures with the countries in the Home Office analysis.   The Home Office analysis showed that between 2015 and 2016 the number of robberies in England and Wales increased more than in any of the other 12 countries examined. That doesn’t mean that the actual number of robberies was higher, even if you account for the different population sizes in each country. In 2016 the robbery rate in England and Wales was 96 per 100,000 people—lower than the USA, Spain and France, but above the other countries examined.   Despite increasing by a third in 2017 to 127 per 100,000, the robbery rate is still lower than the rate in France, but is now higher than the USA (some of the 12 countries in the original analysis haven’t released figures for 2017 yet so we can’t make a full comparison). Because each country records crime data in different ways, comparing data between countries should be taken with a pinch of salt. Recorded crime doesn’t capture the total level of crime as it doesn’t include crime that isn’t reported to the police. We don’t know how high the levels of reporting and recording are in each country. This could mean that that while some countries can have similar recorded robbery figures, the number of robberies that actually happen may be very different. Also police forces record crime differently in different countries. Most countries in Europe record crimes when they are initially reported to the police (input statistics). But in Germany and Spain crime is recorded when the investigation is over (output statistics) which Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office, say tends to be lower than input statistics.    And there are slightly different definitions of robbery in each country that affect comparability. For example, some countries exclude forms of bag-snatching, which are included in the robbery statistics for other European countries.","
 
The increase in the number and rate of recorded robberies between 2015 and 2016 was greater in England and Wales than in any of 12 other countries examined in Home Office analysis. But in Spain, the USA and France the actual number and rate of robberies was higher than in England and Wales.

More people are being prosecuted for carrying a blade.
","“On the law enforcement side we’re catching more people carrying a blade, more are being prosecuted than ever before, and they spend longer in prison.” Dominic Raab MP, 17 May 2018 Between 2016 and 2017, there was a 33% increase in the number of offences relating to possession of an article with a blade or point recorded by police in England and Wales. There were over 17,000 offences involving possession of an article with a blade or point in 2017. The number of recorded offences involving possession of a knife in England and Wales has increased in recent years, though some of this rise could be down to improved police recording and “targeted police action in relation to knife crime”. Before then, recorded knife possession offences were on a downward trend since specifically recording possession of knives was introduced in 2009. Recorded knife crime generally has also been increasing and you can read more about that in our knife crime supercheck. There was a 12% increase in prosecutions for possession of an article with blade or point offences in England and Wales between 2016 and 2017, to just under 9,000. That includes prosecutions against children. The figures are for those prosecutions where possession of a knife was the defendant’s most serious offence if multiple offences are being tried.  There was a 9% rise in the number of knife and offensive weapon offences—specifically those relating to possession and aggravated possession—that led to a caution or a conviction in England and Wales between 2016 and 2017. The average custodial sentence for a knife or offensive weapon possession offence in England and Wales rose by 2.2 months between 2008 and 2017, to 7.5 months. 38% of offenders were sentenced to more than six months, compared to 20% in 2008. In 2015, a new minimum sentence of six months was introduced for adults convicted of possessing a knife or offensive weapon for the second time or more. Convictions are now more likely to result in a custodial sentence. In 2017, 63% of convictions of a knife or offensive weapon offence result in immediate custody or a suspended sentence, compared to 42% in 2008. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","
 
Correct. There was a 12% increase in the number of prosecutions for possession of an article with blade or point in England and Wales between 2016 and 2017, to just under 9,000. It’s been rising since at least 2013.

Before then, recorded knife possession offences were on a downward trend since specifically recording possession of knives was introduced in 2009. Recorded knife crime generally has also been increasing and you can read more about that in our knife crime supercheck. There was a 12% increase in prosecutions for possession of an article with blade or point offences in England and Wales between 2016 and 2017, to just under 9,000. That includes prosecutions against children. The figures are for those prosecutions where possession of a knife was the defendant’s most serious offence if multiple offences are being tried.  There was a 9% rise in the number of knife and offensive weapon offences—specifically those relating to possession and aggravated possession—that led to a caution or a conviction in England and Wales between 2016 and 2017. The average custodial sentence for a knife or offensive weapon possession offence in England and Wales rose by 2.2 months between 2008 and 2017, to 7.5 months. 38% of offenders were sentenced to more than six months, compared to 20% in 2008. In 2015, a new minimum sentence of six months was introduced for adults convicted of possessing a knife or offensive weapon for the second time or more. Convictions are now more likely to result in a custodial sentence. In 2017, 63% of convictions of a knife or offensive weapon offence result in immediate custody or a suspended sentence, compared to 42% in 2008. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","
 
Correct. The average custodial sentence for a knife or offensive weapon possession offence increased by 2.2 months between 2008 and 2017.

The use of stop and search has fallen by almost two thirds since reforms to the system.
","“In London, about one in three stops and searches results in some positive thing being found… something that you shouldn't have... that is quite a high proportion, frankly. “Our outcome rate—one in three positive—is the same, whether you're black or white or whoever you are.” Cressida Dick, 8 August 2017 “…before the reforms took effect, of more than one million stops taking place each year, fewer than one in ten ever led to an arrest… Since the reforms, the number of stop and searches has come down by almost two thirds while latest figures show that the stop-to-arrest rate is now the highest on record.” Amber Rudd, 9 August 2017 It’s correct that the use of stops and searches has fallen both in London and across England and Wales, following policy changes a few years ago. Officers do find something in about a third of cases in London, that’s more than the average for the whole of England and Wales. Black people remain much more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, and this gap has widened in the most recent year we have figures for. Almost all stops and searches take place under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and laws associated with that. It’s used by police to search people for things like drugs, weapons and stolen property, provided the officer has a reasonable cause to suspect they will find something. The use of section 1 searches has been declining rapidly in the last few years. Stops and searches can take place under different laws as well, but those have also been falling rapidly and have now fallen largely out of use. This is due to changes in policy since 2012 to increase ‘fair use’ of the powers by the Home Office and Metropolitan Police. The government also started a new scheme in 2014 called ‘Best use of stop and search’ which aimed to increase transparency around how stops and searches happened and to make forces more effective at identifying appropriate cases for using the powers. These changes have led to sharp falls in the use of stop and search both in London and throughout England and Wales. The use of stop and search in England and Wales peaked in 2008/09 when over 1.5 million were carried out. It has declined in every year since then. Since 2011/12—just before the police changes were brought in—stops and searches have fallen by two-thirds, as Amber Rudd correctly says. The latest figures put them at under 400,000 in 2015/16.  London has seen the same pattern. Stops and searches peaked in 2008/09 at nearly 600,000 and have fallen since to just under 160,000. Stop and searches are still much more common in London, once you factor in the resident population. This doesn’t take into account of the fact that a lot of people come to London from outside on a daily basis as well and could be stopped and searched but not counted in the population figures. Amber Rudd is correct about the increased arrest rate from stops and searches. Only 9% of stops and searches resulted in an arrest at the peak of its use between 2008 and 2011. That proportion has increased in the years since and was 16% by 2015/16. Arrests are more likely in London—with 19% of searches resulting in arrest in the same year. The most recent figures to June this year show the rate now at 20%. That’s according to figures gathered over the last year by the Metropolitan Police, and matches Cressida Dick’s claim. These are called “positive outcome” searches—which refers to any case where action is taken against people who’ve been stopped and searched. This includes arrest cases but also covers other resolutions like warnings and Penalty Notices. All cases where there isn’t a positive outcome are called ‘No Further Actions’. As Cressida Dick also says, the outcome rates are similar whatever people’s ethnicity is. White people are slightly more likely to have something found on them than black or Asian people, but the rate is roughly a third for all three groups. Across the rest of England and Wales, about a quarter of stops and searches had a positive outcome in 2015/16. This figure could be higher in reality because some No Further Action cases do involve detentions under the Mental Health Act or informal advice being given when an officer has found something untoward. At least, that’s what the latest ‘experimental figures’—i.e. to be interpreted with caution—show. These cover figures from just under half of police forces in England and Wales, not including the Metropolitan Police in London. They also find that whether someone is white or not makes little difference—the rate is still about 20%. Again, these cover ‘positive outcomes’ of stops and searches, but they’re different to the figures mentioned in the previous section because they only include cases where the officer found what they were searching for in the first place. The majority of the population is white and the majority of stops and searches involve white people. Per person, black people are more likely to be stopped and searched. Black people are about six times as likely to be stopped and searched as white people. Five in every 1,000 white people was stopped and searched in 2015/16, compared to 31 in every 1,000 black people.  The difference in rates between white and black people has grown since last year. Stops and searches have fallen in the last year overall but those involving white people have fallen faster than those involving black people. Black people are most likely to be arrested following a stop and search. 22% of stops and searches on black people resulted in an arrest in 2015/16, compared to 14% of those conducted on white people. We have more figures just for the Metropolitan Police in London covering the 11 months from August 2016 to June 2017. Black people seem more likely to be stopped in London than elsewhere in the country in recent years. White people are also more likely to be stopped in the capital. Black people were four times as likely to be stopped and searched in London as white people—they were stopped 38.5 times per 1,000 people compared to 9.8 times for white people.","

Black people were four times as likely to be stopped and searched in London as white people—they were stopped 38.5 times per 1,000 people compared to 9.8 times for white people.","

Newly qualified NHS nurses, paramedics, midwives, radiographers, care assistants, physiotherapists and occupational therapists are considered unskilled workers under a new set of immigration rules.
","An image of a tweet, shared 5,000 times on Facebook, claims that under the government’s new immigration rules anyone earning less than £25,600 is classed as an unskilled worker. It then lists various health professions for which the starting salary is under £25,600. It isn’t correct to say that these professions are classed as unskilled. Newly qualified people in these roles, with the exception of care assistants, meet the immigration skills threshold. Care assistants do meet the threshold in certain circumstances. These claims stem from the government’s recent announcement that it would be introducing a “points-based” immigration system . Not all the details of the new immigration system have been confirmed. However, what we know is that under the new system, all applicants must: In addition they must meet a salary level which varies depending on circumstances. Their salary offer must be: In general, visa applicants must also have a salary offer at the “going rate”, which essentially means that they are paid competitively for the job they’re applying for. However, there will be exceptions to this requirement for some occupations that work on published pay scales, and also for new entrants. The tweet implies that as new starters to the NHS in various roles have salaries below the required minimum, and so the government considers nurses, paramedics, midwives, radiographers, care assistants, physiotherapists and occupational therapists “unskilled.” It implies this by correctly listing the starting salary of £24,200 for all these roles, with the exception of care assistants who start on £17,600. But jobs aren’t classed as skilled based on salary. The skills threshold is set at something called “regulation qualification” level 3 (RQF 3) or above. All of these professions listed except care assistants are at RQF 6 and so meet the skills threshold. Care assistants only meet the government’s immigration skills threshold if they have a certain level of seniority and/or experience.   Additionally, someone with a job offer to do any of the listed jobs apart from care assistants and physiotherapists would be immediately eligible to apply for a work visa under the new system because they are considered shortage occupations. This is provided they meet the other mandatory criteria of being able to speak English and have a salary offer of £20,480 or above. All the starting salaries mentioned in the image are correct, for England in 2019/20. Qualified nurses tend to start on a band 5, which is currently £24,214. Paramedics, midwives, radiographers, physiotherapists and occupational therapists also start at a band 5. Care assistants tend to start on a band 2, which is £17,652.     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as partly false        because while most of the salaries are accurate, it is incorrect to claim that anyone earning less than £25,600 is considered an unskilled worker under the new migration policy.    ","
 
Incorrect. All of the listed jobs apart from care assistants meet the skills threshold under new immigration rules.

There is little evidence that falling wages are being caused by migration, aside from in construction.
","“I agree that unfettered mass immigration has been used to depress wages, especially on the low skill level.” Lionel Shriver, 24 May 2018 “If you look at the evidence of why we have seen wages going down, there is actually very little evidence that that is being caused by migration, aside from in construction.” Anneliese Dodds, 24 May 2018 Both panellists hit on a key point: the impact of immigration on wages depends on who you are, what kind of job you do and where you do it. It also might not be the same from year to year. It is difficult to measure the overall effects of immigration on jobs definitively. Studies that have tried to do it in the UK have sometimes reached opposing conclusions about whether it increases or decreases wages overall but they tend to agree that immigration has a small impact on average wages of existing workers. The effects of immigration on workers within specific wage ranges or in specific occupations are more significant. There is quite a lot of evidence that immigration affects low-waged workers the most negatively, and not just in construction. The available research also shows that any declines in wages are likely to be greatest for resident workers who are themselves migrants. This is because the skills of new immigrants are likely to be more similar to the skills of migrants already employed in the UK than for those of UK-born workers. Declines in the wages and employment of UK-born workers in the short run can be offset by rising wages and employment in the long run. Read our full briefing on How immigrants affect jobs and wages, which was written by Oxford University’s Migration Observatory in collaboration with Full Fact. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","
 
Studies find that immigration affects low-waged workers the most, in low-skilled and semi-skilled jobs generally not just in construction.

We have the highest female employment rate on record.

A higher proportion of women aged 16-64 are in paid work than ever before and the same is true if you count everyone up to state pension age. There’s still a nine percentage point gap between the employment rate for men and women aged 16-64. We also have very near to the highest ever percentage of women on FTSE 100 boards, according to the professional forum Boards Watch. The FTSE 100 includes the hundred most highly-valued companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. About 27% of directors on their boards are women: 32% of non-executive directors and 10% of executive directors. The proportion seems to have fallen fractionally in the months leading up to March 2017, although that’s nothing compared to the large year-on-year increases that came previously. Finally, it’s true that the gender pay gap is the lowest on record by median hourly earnings. That’s correct whether you compare hourly earnings across all workers, or just look at full time workers. There’s still a gap. If you knew nothing about two people except that one was a man, one was a woman, and both were working full-time, then you’d expect the woman to earn about £1.34 per hour less than the man.

The employment rate has never been higher.

The gender pay gap increases after women become mothers.
","“If you’re a woman in your twenties you will earn 95p for every pound that young men of your age earn.” Jo Swinson, BBC Today Programme, 4 January 2017 That’s a justifiable thing to say if you look at millennials. Jo Swinson based her claim on analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank. It looked at survey data from the Office for National Statistics and found that middle-earning women born between 1981 and 2000 earned around 5% per hour less than their male counterparts, a smaller gap than in previous generations. In other words, if you knew absolutely nothing else about two workers in the UK, aside from the fact that one was a woman, one was a man, and both were in their twenties, on average you would expect the woman to earn roughly 5% less per hour than the man. The claim also happens to be justified if you look at the middle-earning woman each week aged 22-29. She earned around 6% less each week than the middle-earning man last year. Although there is a gap between the pay of men and women, it’s harder to say what the statistic tells us. As the Resolution Foundation pointed out, its measure of the ‘gender pay gap’ isn’t comparing like-with-like. It’s comparing median average earnings in the whole group of women who work, against the whole group of men who work. That’s a bit different from what people often think of as the ‘gender pay gap’: the idea that a woman will be paid less than a man for doing exactly the same job. For one reason or another, men and women in the UK tend towards different kinds of jobs, tend to work different hours, and arguably develop different skills and experience. So there are a range of additional reasons why the gender pay gap might exist, alongside the possibility of outright discrimination. Although gendered wage inequalities suggest a lot about the way we organise and value different kinds of work across society as a whole, and particularly how these kinds of social pressures and choices are gendered, they aren’t a direct measure of discrimination in the workplace. And there’s more than one reasonable way to measure them. The ONS suggests looking at full-time workers alone is a good headline measure. But the Resolution Foundation told us that it chose to include part-time workers this time, since it thinks the gap in hourly pay between full-time and part-time work is an important issue. As the ONS has put it: “…there is no single measure that fully deals with the complex issue of the differences between men’s and women’s pay” Different measures of the gender pay gap will capture different aspects of how the UK labour market is shaped by gender. “…women are going ahead of men before they have children and when they are concentrating on their careers, but what clearly is not happening is women are not maintaining their position ahead of men once they make different decisions about the priority of family life.” Jill Kirby, BBC Today Program, 4 January 2017 On the one hand, there’s evidence that the gender pay gap increases later in life, partly as women become mothers. A recent report by the IFS think tank chose a third measure of the gap to both the Resolution Foundation and the ONS, which helped illustrate a different point: it showed that although a gap in mean average pay for men and women exists before people become parents, the gap increases steadily and substantially for 12 years after the birth of their first child. The IFS’ main interpretation is that mothers who choose to take time out of work miss out on workplace skills and experience, and so lose the opportunity for career progression. As with other statistics on gendered pay inequalities, there’s room for a range of interpretations. On the other hand, we haven’t seen clear evidence yet that the same women are getting ahead of men in terms of pay before they have children. The IFS found that over a third of the eventual difference in average wages between mothers and fathers existed before the first child was born. Jill Kirby pointed us to a Guardian article from 2015, which was based on data collected by the Press Association. This suggested that women in their twenties were earning more than men. It’s not clear exactly how these figures were put together, or whether the analysis is still up-to-date, so we’ve asked the Press Association for the original release. Back in 2015, it was true that women aged 22-29 working full-time earned more each hour than their male counterparts. That was no longer the case in 2016.","

Ken Clarke, former Conservative Chancellor said he won’t vote for the Conservatives.
","Today Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott tweeted about media coverage of former Labour MP Ian Austin, claiming that it was unbalanced when contrasted with coverage of comments made recently by former Conservative MP and Chancellor Ken Clarke.   Ian Austin, 1 year as a junior minister at DCLG, says he won't vote for Labour. Wall-to-wall coverage. Ken Clarke, 9 years as Secretary of State, including as Chancellor, says he won't vote for the Conservatives. Silence. Balanced election coverage? While it’s true that the two sets of comments received different levels of media attention, Ms Abbott’s phrasing doesn’t portray them entirely accurately, overstating what Ken Clarke said and implying the two sets of comments to be more similar than they are. Mr Austin didn’t just say he personally wouldn’t vote Labour this election; this morning he explicitly called on Labour voters to vote for the Conservatives. Meanwhile Ken Clarke did not say he “won’t vote for the Conservatives.” He did say that it was a possibility that he would not, but that it would depend on the campaign the Conservative party ran, and that he did not expect them to run a campaign which would cost them his vote. On 1 November he told Channel 4 News (after prefacing his statement with “I’m slightly teasing you and myself”) that his voting Conservative was “not as certain as it has been in previous elections.” He added: “It depends what sort of campaign the party run. If we really do make ourselves the Brexit Party under our brand, my loyalty is going to be strained absolutely… I am not voting for some crazy right-wing nationalist organisation calling themselves a Conservative government—but that I think is laying it on a bit, I don't think that’s where we’ll wind up.” It’s perfectly true to say, as Ms Abbott does, that Mr Clarke’s comments received relatively limited media attention while Mr Austin’s have been widely reported. And it’s a legitimate matter of opinion as to whether media coverage of the two events has shown an imbalance against Labour or not. But presenting the two sets of comments in a way that makes them seem precisely equivalent, to justify that charge of imbalance, is misleading.","
 
Incorrect. Mr Clarke said he would not vote for the Conservatives if it campaigned as “some crazy right-wing nationalist organisation” but also said that “I don’t think that will be where we end up”.

Men in Teesside have the same life expectancy as those in Ethiopia.
","“Men in [Boris Johnson’s] constituency live 14 years longer than in mine… Just when is he going to end this scandal, that means that Teesside men have the same life expectancy of those in Ethiopia, and tackle the health inequalities in our area.”  Alex Cunningham MP, 22 January 2020  “His point is absolutely valid, and the discrepancy in life expectancy in this country is a disgrace. But it is coming down and it will come down. Life expectancy overall is at an all-time high.”  Boris Johnson 22 January 2020 During Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, the MP for Stockton North, Alex Cunningham, said that men in Boris Johnson’s constituency “live 14 years longer than in mine”. As a result, he added, “Teesside men have the same life expectancy of those in Ethiopia”. Alex Cunningham’s office told us that this figure came from a BBC report about the large life expectancy gap within Stockton-on-Tees. This mentions Stockton Town Centre, a ward in Mr Cunningham’s constituency where male life expectancy is 64. The BBC article is correct, although the figure has since risen to 65. This is about the same figure that the World Bank recorded for men in Ethiopia in 2017. UK life expectancy figures are not published by constituency, but men in the London borough of Hillingdon, which contains the prime minister’s constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, have a life expectancy of 80.4. That’s about 15 or 16 years higher than the ward in Stockton. Mr Cunningham’s office said they chose 14 as a conservative estimate because the BBC article was slightly dated. It’s worth bearing in mind that these figures don’t mean that men are predicted to live as long as 64 or 80.4 years in these areas, because health and mortality rates are usually expected to improve by the time men born today reach these ages. A life expectancy of 64 is extremely low for the UK, where the latest average for men is 79.3, so it is understandable that Mr Cunningham and the BBC would want to bring Stockton Town Centre to public attention. However, the adult population there makes up less than a tenth of registered voters in Stockton North, so Mr Cunningham is wrong to suggest that their story represents his constituency in general, let alone Teesside as a whole. In fact, men in the borough of Stockton-on-Tees have an average life expectancy of 78.1, just two years less than in Hillingdon and 14 more than in Ethiopia.  In his reply, Boris Johnson called the discrepancy in life expectancy in the UK “a disgrace”. “But it is coming down and it will come down,” he added. It is not clear whether the Prime Minister had in mind the discrepancy in life expectancy between rich and poor, or between the North East and London, but he is wrong in either case. Life expectancy in the North East continues to rise more slowly than it does in London, widening the gap between them all the time. Measuring the life expectancy gap by income is more complicated, but analysis by scientists on the Longevity Science Panel shows that it was widening, at least until 2015, which is the most recent data in the analysis. It is true that UK life expectancy is at an all-time high, but it is now rising much more slowly than it has in the past, and at different rates for different people.

Men in one very deprived ward of Stockton have the same life expectancy as men in Ethiopia, according to figures from the World Bank in 2017. This isn’t the case for Teesside as a whole.

The gap in UK life expectancies is falling.
","“Men in [Boris Johnson’s] constituency live 14 years longer than in mine… Just when is he going to end this scandal, that means that Teesside men have the same life expectancy of those in Ethiopia, and tackle the health inequalities in our area.”  Alex Cunningham MP, 22 January 2020  “His point is absolutely valid, and the discrepancy in life expectancy in this country is a disgrace. But it is coming down and it will come down. Life expectancy overall is at an all-time high.”  Boris Johnson 22 January 2020 During Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, the MP for Stockton North, Alex Cunningham, said that men in Boris Johnson’s constituency “live 14 years longer than in mine”. As a result, he added, “Teesside men have the same life expectancy of those in Ethiopia”. Alex Cunningham’s office told us that this figure came from a BBC report about the large life expectancy gap within Stockton-on-Tees. This mentions Stockton Town Centre, a ward in Mr Cunningham’s constituency where male life expectancy is 64. The BBC article is correct, although the figure has since risen to 65. This is about the same figure that the World Bank recorded for men in Ethiopia in 2017. UK life expectancy figures are not published by constituency, but men in the London borough of Hillingdon, which contains the prime minister’s constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, have a life expectancy of 80.4. That’s about 15 or 16 years higher than the ward in Stockton. Mr Cunningham’s office said they chose 14 as a conservative estimate because the BBC article was slightly dated. It’s worth bearing in mind that these figures don’t mean that men are predicted to live as long as 64 or 80.4 years in these areas, because health and mortality rates are usually expected to improve by the time men born today reach these ages. A life expectancy of 64 is extremely low for the UK, where the latest average for men is 79.3, so it is understandable that Mr Cunningham and the BBC would want to bring Stockton Town Centre to public attention. However, the adult population there makes up less than a tenth of registered voters in Stockton North, so Mr Cunningham is wrong to suggest that their story represents his constituency in general, let alone Teesside as a whole. In fact, men in the borough of Stockton-on-Tees have an average life expectancy of 78.1, just two years less than in Hillingdon and 14 more than in Ethiopia.  In his reply, Boris Johnson called the discrepancy in life expectancy in the UK “a disgrace”. “But it is coming down and it will come down,” he added. It is not clear whether the Prime Minister had in mind the discrepancy in life expectancy between rich and poor, or between the North East and London, but he is wrong in either case. Life expectancy in the North East continues to rise more slowly than it does in London, widening the gap between them all the time. Measuring the life expectancy gap by income is more complicated, but analysis by scientists on the Longevity Science Panel shows that it was widening, at least until 2015, which is the most recent data in the analysis. It is true that UK life expectancy is at an all-time high, but it is now rising much more slowly than it has in the past, and at different rates for different people. We’ve looked at these figures in more detail before.","
 
Not true. The life expectancy gap between rich and poor, and between the northeast and London, is rising.

We’re seeing fewer families in relative poverty in the UK.
","“The last Labour Government took 800,000 children out of poverty…” Jeremy Corbyn, 30 November 2016 That’s correct by one reasonable measure. But there are many different measures of poverty. Mr Corbyn is talking about the number of children in relative poverty, which fell by about 800,000 between 1997/98 and 2009/10, not taking housing costs into account. It’s also reasonable to consider incomes when housing costs are included. By that measure, the number of children in relative poverty fell by less over the same period. It fell by about 300,000. Households in relative poverty have an income that’s less than 60% of the middle-earning household—in other words, they’re poor relative to other households in the UK.  This can sometimes lead to counter-intuitive conclusions. For example, it would be a bit odd to say that a family was lifted out of poverty simply because other families on the street got poorer. Another measure is absolute poverty, which the government defines as having an income less than 60% of the middle-earner in 2010/11. By that measure, the number of children in poverty fell even more under New Labour. About 2.7 million fewer children were living in absolute poverty by the end of the last Labour government, or 2.1 million fewer if you take housing costs into account. “...Under her government child poverty is rising and now covers 4 million children across the country.” Jeremy Corbyn, 30 November 2016 It’s also correct that the best estimate for the number of children in relative poverty has risen since 2010. It’s not risen by enough to say, with confidence, that we’re seeing a real change in poverty rather than a chance variation in the estimate. On the other hand, the estimate has risen consistently each year. It was down to 3.6 million in 2010. It now stands at 3.9 million. “We are seeing fewer families in absolute poverty and fewer families in relative poverty.” Theresa May, 30 November 2016 We’ve asked No. 10 which time period Mrs. May is referring to here. If you look at the trends  since the 2010 election, it’s wrong to say that the number of families living in relative poverty is falling.  The government’s best estimate for both the number of children and the number of individuals in relatively poor households increased between 2010/11 and 2014/15, whether you look at it before or after housing costs. On the other hand, it’s true that the DWP’s best estimate for the number of people living in absolute poverty has fallen slightly since 2010/11, having peaked in 2012/13. Again, that’s the case whether you take housing costs into account or not. The best estimate for the number of children in absolute poverty has remained broadly stable over the same time period. Again, none of these changes are large enough to say for certain that we’re seeing a real change in poverty rather than a chance variation in the estimate. It gets easier to spot trends in the figures if you look at longer time periods, so we’ve looked at the long term trends in our poverty guide. This fact check is part of a roundup of Prime Minister's Questions. Read the roundup.","
 
It depends how you look at it and what time period you pick. If you take the claim to be referring to the period since 2010, that’s incorrect. The number of children or people living in relative poverty has risen since then, whether or not you include housing costs.
